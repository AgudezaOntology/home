Chapter Four Agudeza y arte de ingenio The Agudeza y arte de ingenio of is a revised version of Gracián Arte de ingenio tratado de la agudeza published in Despite the considerable amplification of the  version there is very little change in doctrine between the two texts and this chapter will use the revised  version as the basis of its analysis The original Arte de ingenio appeared after the publication of El Héroe and El Político and before the publication of El Discreto and the Oráculo The reworked Agudeza appeared two years after the publication of El Discreto and one year after the publication of the Oráculo The contents of the Arte de ingenio were therefore present in Gracián mind throughout the production of El Discreto and the Oráculo and it is likely that his revision of this text took place alongside the writing of these latter treatises too The fact that Gracián carried out a revision of the Arte de ingenio suggests that its contents were firstly important enough to him to revisit and secondly unsatisfactorily expressed in the first instance Whatever Gracián motivations for reworking the Arte de ingenio may have been it is the case that even after revising it the text did not achieve the same success as his other works as evidenced by the translation history of Gracián works throughout Europe n France all of Gracián works have been translated except the Arte de ingenio and the Agudeza only appeared in French translation in n England all of Gracián works except El Político have been translated although El Criticón was only translated partially in by Paul Rycaut and the English translation of the Agudeza is a PhD thesis by Leland Chambers which remains unpublished n taly all of Gracián works were translated between and except the Agudeza which was finally translated in And in Germany all of Gracián works except El Héroe and the Agudeza have been translated n fact the Agudeza is the only work by Gracián which was not translated into any language and published until Pérez Lasheras This pattern is reflected in Spain where the Agudeza and the Arte de ingenio were not reedited after their initial publications until the twentieth century When we compare this general neglect of the Agudeza with the editorial success of El Héroe and the Oráculo in Spain and beyond as outlined in the previous chapter it becomes clear that the Agudeza failed to reach the same level of popularity as many of Gracián other works Given that the Agudeza is the text in which Gracián outlines his ideas of ingenio of the concepto and of agudeza itself it follows that readers lack of engagement with it has inevitably led to a lack of understanding or to a misunderstanding of the centrality of these elements in Gracián thought and of how they function The importance of taking the time to understand ingenio the concepto and agudeza is stressed by Sarmiento when he states that The conceit and the whole attitude implied by the conceit is a thing that has to be understood and approached sympathetically if the Spanish mind and language are to be known at all For the conceit and the conceptist art and if one may call it so the conceptist mentality are an essential aspect of Spain Gracián too acknowledges that the conceptist mentality is uniquely Spanish when he writes in his Al lector to the Agudeza si frecuento los españoles es porque la agudeza prevalece en ellos así como la erudición en los franceses la elocuencia en los italianos y la invención en los griegos As such and in agreement with Juan Huarte de San Juans theorising in the Examen de ingenios para las ciencias Gracián explicitly highlights that there are national dispositions which lead to different ways of approaching the world Zárate Ruiz with the implication that failing to understand agudeza will lead to a failure to understand the Spanish and their thinking Blanco points out that Voltaire in the Art dramatique article of the Dictionnaire philosophique outlines the opposition between the Spanish mentality and that of the French by describing the former with derision and disparagement as tout ingénieux quelque grandeur quils aient dans lesprit We therefore see that ingenio was considered by both Spaniards themselves and by foreign commentators to be associated with an inherently Spanish way of viewing and synthesising the world Furthermore as Voltaire here demonstrates this Spanish way of approaching the world is often treated with disdain The previous chapter discussed in relation to the Oráculo the important influence that the filter of French Rationalism had for the assimilation of Gracián works throughout Europe particularly through the popularity of Amelot de la Houssaies French translation of the Oráculo which was often the primary channel via which many French and German thinkers accessed Gracián thinking The existence of conflicting national philosophical temperaments the tendency of France to elevate a Cartesian version of objective reason the lack of success of Gracián Agudeza and the success of French translations of Gracián works all lead to the probable conclusion that the faculty of ingenio as an alternative conceptualisation of reason and as a tool in the armour of understanding has not been well diffused by translators or understood by readers both Spanish and foreign On one hand the general neglect of the Agudeza is not surprising Gracián versions of ingenio the concepto and agudeza are difficult to conceptualise and even more difficult to express in words On the other hand their centrality to Gracián thinking cannot be overemphasised meaning that an attempt to understand them is essential in order to understand Gracián works both before the Agudeza and after particularly El Criticón and El Comulgatorio This chapter will aim to shed light on these elements of Gracián thought To do so it will firstly discuss the readers misplaced expectation that agudeza function as a rhetorical device and will show through an analysis of the term concepto that agudeza and the concepto instead function as a link between the realms of ser and parecer and lead to the intuitive spontaneous and transient perception and expression of universal insight This means that their remit lies primarily within ontology and epistemology and not within rhetoric Secondly this chapter will examine the nature of this epistemological knowledge aligning it with temporary and transient aesthetic experience and not with an objective and atemporal notion of universal Truth Finally the chapter will close by examining of El Criticón in which Gracián demonstrates clearly the way in which ingenio the concepto and agudeza function reflecting back upon the seeds of this scene within the Agudeza Defining the Concepto From Rhetoric to Ontology and Epistemology The titles of both versions of the text Arte de ingenio tratado de la agudeza and Agudeza y arte de ingenio show Gracián playing with his readers expectations n the seventeenth century arte art referred to a group of rules governing a skill and would have provoked the expectation of a systematic scientific and definitive analysis based upon rational precepts along the lines of Horace Ars Poetica or Lope de Vegas Arte nuevo de hacer comedias en este tiempo for example Blanco Grady ngenio on the other hand was commonly taken to mean innate genius granted upon birth and unsuitable for being taught or acquired This creates an immediate paradox for the reader of the time challenging both the idea that any rational arte can conclusively and atemporally define the bounds of its subject matter and the idea that ingenio cannot be learned and developed through practice Andersen n discurso of the Agudeza Gracián gives an indication of how these two terms can coincide privilegio es de ciencia reducir a principios generales su enseñanza Son las máximas doctrinales lo que el nombre dice cabezas y como fuentes del discurrir los fundamentos del enseñar For Gracián the headings and subsections which characterise works of science do not function when applied to his subject matter of agudeza Rather he outlines the idea that the subsections and discursos of the Agudeza represent general guidelines which serve as mere points of departure When applied to the real world further consideration of contingent circumstances is needed This commingling of universal precepts with particular circumstances entails infinite variety precluding conclusiveness and therefore preparing the reader of the Agudeza for a certain level of indeterminacy at odds with what the contemporary reader may have expected of the text title of arte This is demonstrated by the way in which Gracián makes a superficial attempt to classify the different types of agudeza into groups in discurso This charade of definitive classification suggests to the scholastically educated reader accustomed to treatises on classical rhetoric such as Cicero Topica that the Agudeza will go on to be structured according to these classifications However Gracián initial classifications soon begin to subdivide he offers new classifications without clarity as to whether these override previous ones or not and it is unclear whether the headings of the sixty discursos which follow conform with any of the classifications which have been offered For example Gracián first distinguishes between agudeza de perspicacia and agudeza de artificio He then subdivides agudeza de artificio into agudeza de concepto agudeza verbal and agudeza de acción He goes on to offer three alternative categorisations with no indication of how these align with the earlier one or with each other agudeza de correspondencia y conformidad and agudeza de contrariedad o discordancia agudeza pura and agudeza mixta and agudeza incompleja and agudeza compuesta Agudeza incompleja is then subdivided into agudeza de correlación y conveniencia agudeza de ponderación juiciosa agudeza de raciocinación and agudeza de invención While the usual result of classification is clarity as to the structure of the work to follow the reader of discurso I of the Agudeza is left with the sentiment that the underlying coherence of the work has somehow eluded them supporting the idea that Gracián intention in theorising upon agudeza is to repudiate conclusiveness and to proliferate variety Nevertheless Gracián inclusion of the word arte in his title his façade of logical classification and his use of the lexicon and argumentation of classical rhetoric see for example discursos lends the Agudeza a scholastic cast which likely created the impression of familiar territory for its contemporary readers May However by conforming to the familiar in some ways through language and style of argumentation and by subverting it in others through the rejection of structural coherence it could be argued that Gracián deviated too far from the norm resulting in the text lack of popularity theories of rhetoric were abundant during the Renaissance and it is understandable that a scholastically educated reader should want to avoid what they perceive as a badly written one Likewise if taken as a theory book the Agudeza is also lacking most theorising takes place in discurso and discurso I and each discurso tends to open with one or two lines of explanation beyond this the text proliferates with examples of agudeza with very little substantial comment alongside The text scholastic cast can also be alienating for the modern reader for whom the rhetorical tradition represents a largely forgotten but intricate body of lore Grady Menéndez Pelayo for example describes the Agudeza as Gracián worst work and as un tratado de preceptiva literaria cuyo error consiste en haber reducido todas las calidades del estilo a una sola HidalgoSerna also summarises su agudeza ha sido interpretada como simple juego de palabras y en su noción de ingenio fue vista sólo la fuente del ornato puramente formal Were the Agudeza to be contributing anything beyond badly articulated rhetorical theory in its deliberation of agudeza and ingenio as this chapter will presently argue it has certainly been missed by most of its readers The erroneous supposition here is that the Agudeza is a book of rhetorical theory and that agudeza itself is nothing more than a rhetorical stylistic device This supposition is revealed to be incorrect upon close reading of the text in which Gracián repeatedly points out that there is indeed a relation between rhetoric and agudeza but that the latter is not subsumed into the former For example he writes Siempre ha de haber alguna circunstancia especial en que se funde la conformidad de los términos para levantar la comparación conceptuosa que sin ésta no será sutileza sino una desnuda figura retórica sin viveza de ingenio I Here Gracián identifies particular circumstances rather than universal precepts the concepto and ingenio as facets which can transform and elevate una desnuda figura retórica into something more nuanced Son los tropos y figuras retóricas materia y como fundamento para que sobre ellos levante sus primores la agudeza y lo que la retórica tiene por formalidad esta nuestra arte por materia sobre que echa la esmalte de su artificio Again agudeza is described as something which elevates los tropos y figuras retóricas which are described as the materia with which agudeza works Agudeza builds upon the fundamento of rhetoric adding to it la esmalte de su artificio indicating its artful and deliberated nature Tiene la agudeza también sus argumentos que si en los dialécticos reina la eficacia en los retóricos la elocuencia en éstos la belleza I While rhetoric concerns itself with eloquent expression Gracián here points out that the primary concern of agudeza is with belleza introducing the idea that the remit of agudeza extends beyond the realm of witty expression into the realm of the aesthetic examined in more detail later in this chapter Cífranse en este discurso muchas otras especies de sutileza repitiendo siempre que la agudeza tiene por materia y por fundamento muchas de las figuras retóricas pero dales la forma y realce del concepto L Gracián repeats the idea that las figuras retóricas provide the materia and fundamento for agudeza to take place but that agudeza elevates these by giving them the forma y realce of the concepto again indicating that agudeza and the concepto produce something more transcendent than rhetoric alone No es de escencia de la agudeza fingida el metro y composición poética sino ornato que la prosa suele suplir con su aliñada cultura No está la eminencia en la cantidad de sílabas ni en la cadencia dellas que eso es muy material no pasa del oído sí en la sutileza del pensar en la elegancia del decir en en artificio del discurrir en la profundidad del declarar L Here a distinction is drawn between the formal nature of el metro the composición la cantidad de sílabas and la cadencia dellas in poetry which do not go beyond el oído and the aliñada cultura la sutileza del pensar la elegancia del decir the artificio del discurrir and la profundidad del declarar of prose the latter of which manage to penetrate beyond sense experience into a seemingly deeper part of man intellect Dos cosas hacen perfectos un estilo lo material de las palabras y lo formal de los pensamientos que de ambas eminencias se adecua su perfección Conténtanse unos con sola la alma de la agudeza sin atender a la bizarría del exprimirla antes tienen por felicidad la facilidad del decir aun en la poesía L Gracián differentiates between las palabras which express an idea rhetoric and los pensamientos behind an idea the agudeza When rhetoric and agudeza work together they achieve perfección As such perfect estilo is composed of a delicate balance between surface appearance and soul between the manner of expression and the ideas behind what is being expressed and between form and content Son los conceptos vida del estilo espíritu del decir y tanto tiene de perfección cuanto de sutileza mas cuando se juntan lo realzado del estilo y lo remontado del concepto hacen la obra cabal Again the difference between soul and style is emphasised with the concepto shown to play a pivotal role in the vida and espíritu behind rhetoric When style is combined with lo remontado del concepto the result is la obra cabal perfect expression which reconciles style with substance form with content and rhetoric with agudeza From these examples a picture begins to emerge of the way in which Gracián conceptualises agudeza the concepto and ingenio they function within the remit of particular circumstances which is why they cannot be theorised upon in the same atemporal manner as typical treatises on classical rhetoric they elevate rhetoric imbuing it with more nuance and profundity they are associated with artifice meaning that they are the product of purposeful deliberation and not just of innate ingenuity their purpose lies within the realm of Beauty and aesthetic experience and they work alongside rhetoric to produce a perfect balance between expression and thought form and content Andersen sums up her observations on Gracián differentiation between rhetoric and agudeza by concluding that for Gracián rhetoric refers to the exterior expression of language whilst agudeza refers to the content and to the relation between expression and content If we translate this to the language of seventeenthcentury Spain we can say that rhetoric refers to the parecer of language whilst agudeza and the concepto refer to its ser and to the relation between ser and parecer The reason why this is difficult to conceptualise is because agudeza and the concepto do not simply pertain to the realm of ser whilst rhetoric pertains to that of parecer agudeza and the concepto pertain to the realm of ser as well as to the less neatly conceptualised linkage between the realms of ser and parecer two realms which are often thought of as completely distinct and irreconcilable In other words they connect the worldly realm that of parecer with the more otherworldly realm of ser The reconciliatory role played by agudeza the concepto and ingenio between the realms of ser and parecer is what makes them critical to an understanding of Gracián ontology but it is also what makes them conceptually difficult Sarmiento analysis of the Agudeza serves as a good example of critics tendency to approach agudeza as a rhetorical device and of the frustration which results from the inevitable realisation that agudeza functions beyond the realm of stylistic expression through the reconciliatory role it plays between the remits of ser and parecer and of the frustration which results from the difficulty of articulating how this reconciliatory role between the worldly and the otherworldly functions The focus of Sarmiento article is on examining the extent to which we can differentiate between the conceit the concepto and the simile meaning that he approaches his analysis of agudeza through the lens of its relation to an already established rhetorical device In doing so he disputes Gracián famous definition of the concepto claiming that this cannot define the conceit for the reason that the essence of the conceit lies in its prolongation and therefore has not truly started at the moment of Gracián definition Sarmiento also disagrees with Gracián that a conceit can take the form of narrative fiction arguing that the moment in which the conceit is apprehended must be rapid ruling out the possibility that an extended text read over time can be called a conceit As such Sarmiento argues that the conceit must be more prolonged than a simile but not so much so that it constitutes an extended narrative As this thesis will go on to argue particularly in its analysis of El Criticón in the following chapter Gracián conceptualises the concepto as something which man himself can came to embody meaning that the timeframe within which agudeza and ingenio function can in actual fact be prolonged and projected throughout an entire lifetime Critics tendency to refract Gracián concepto through the lens of rhetorical devices the simile in this case means that the true scope of his philosophy is effaced Sarmiento concedes that the concepto pertains to a more ethereal realm than that of pure rhetoric when he closes his article with the following observation In exalted moods of apprehension we are able to admit all things into a just relationship of regeneration and grace where triviality ceases to exist where consciousness floats on the high seas of complete understanding seeing them one in Christ In such a mood the mind can take any element however humble gross even and see it in its relationship with the whole and perceiving that relationship use it as a term of comparison of elucidation Such moods are rare to many they are unknown and in essence to live in that exaltation is to live the mystical lifeBut these conceptist sermons are fruitless to the mind not already dwelling on the plane of mental and spiritual exaltation they may not arouse understanding they can only excite derision Here Sarmiento arrives at the essence of what agudeza the concepto and ingenio tend towards apprehension consciousness understanding and elucidation all indicate that they afford some sort of insight or knowledge and therefore carry an epistemological function Regeneration and rare indicate that the knowledge granted by agudeza is not permanent and must be continually renewed Exalted high seas exaltation mystical and spiritual exaltation all highlight the otherworldly transcendent nature of the knowledge granted by agudeza And grace Christ and conceptist sermons all point towards the fact that gaining knowledge in this way is a type of spiritual experience In other words agudeza and the concepto via the intellectual faculty of ingenio lead to a frame of mind which allows momentary insight into the interconnectedness and harmoniousness of the world as if from a Godlike stance This momentary insight is akin to aesthetic experience granting man transient and temporary insight into the universal It is precisely the intangibility of the realm within which agudeza the concepto and ingenio function and their inherent malleability and changeability that makes them difficult to define Parker argues that much of the confusion prompted by the Agudeza is a result of the use of the English word conceit to translate all instances of the Spanish word concepto He points out that English has a more direct translation for the word concepto concept and questions why critics have been reluctant to translate it as such He argues that by translating concepto as conceit no differentiation is made between the concepto and agudeza the former chronologically preceding the latter and the latter representing the result of the former Parker claims that using the word conceit means that it can appear as anything from the first simple idea in the mind to a highly complicated relationship of many metaphors in one single poetic discourse This means that no distinction is made between a person having an idea and the expression of this idea in thought in speech in writing or through actions for example To delineate more clearly the transition from concepto the idea to the agudeza conceit the product Parker proposes that concept be used to translate concepto when referring to the idea which the mind conceives and which it develops by extending it to other interrelated ideas and to translate concepto as conceit when referring to a more complex string of correspondences between individual conceptos which then becomes elevated to the status of a conceit agudeza In making this argument Parker outlines a linear temporal process in which a concepto concept is formed in the mind ingenio links this concepto concept to many others and the resulting chain of conceptos concepts is known as a conceit agudeza However as Woods and Blanco point out the progression from concepto to agudeza cannot be so clearly and temporally delineated for the reason that Gracián often uses the two terms interchangeably and respectively As any rational interpreter seeking to understand how agudeza works would be inclined to do Parker chooses to chart the creation of agudeza as a temporalised process which begins with a concepto in the mind the initial idea and ends with the manifestation of this idea in the world the objective product the conceit agudeza Woods on the other hand by interpreting the concepto and agudeza as synonymous denies the possibility of temporality He writes There can be no independent existence of either Where there is a concepto then we have the birth of an agudeza Where there is an agudeza then there must have been a prior concepto the only evidence for which from the audience point of view lies in the final agudeza The concepto in its special sense is a correspondencia as apprehended by the mind as it contemplates the possibility of producing an agudeza based on it The three terms are thus inseparable There can be no agudeza without a concepto and no concepto without a correspondencia The agudeza embodies a concepto and the concepto embodies a correspondencia While Parker endeavours to separate the steps between the concepto concept and the agudeza conceit Woods argues that they are one and the same that the concepto is the agudeza and the agudeza is the concepto both produced simultaneously and unable to exist without the other For Woods agudeza cannot be rationally broken down into a series of steps which can be clearly conceptualised because the concept the idea in the mind and its manifestation are one and the same Parker and Woods therefore conceive of agudeza in two different ways Parker sees agudeza as the result of a conscious and rational process with clearly demarcated start and end points whilst Woods sees it as an unconscious act which materialises within man mind without any active input This brings us to the core of the debate regarding Gracián conceptualisation of agudeza the concepto and ingenio indicated by the paradox of the Agudeza title as an Arte de ingenio is agudeza produced instinctively intuitively and spontaneously as the word ingenio implies or is agudeza the result of a rational process of deliberation and practice as the word arte implies Can both processes result in agudeza as Gracián combination of ingenio and arte seems to imply Or is it that the instinctive intuitive and spontaneous production of agudeza is something that can be perfected through deliberated practice Woods conceptualisation of the concepto agudeza as both the idea in the mind and the objective product finds its roots in the Latin term conceptus from whence the word concepto is derived Blanco points out that the Latin word conceptus signifies both the action of containing and the thing contained Today the Spanish word concepto and the English word concept do not generally incorporate this duality However in medicine the term conceptus is still used to refer to the product of reproductive conception at any stage during the act of fertilisation the embryo and the baby upon birth This can be transposed to the context of the Agudeza to demonstrate that Gracián concepto can refer to the initial stages in the germination of a thought to the coming to fruition of a thought and to the fullyformed thought itself which can remain a thought or can be outwardly articulated or can be represented through action For those trained in scholastic logic such as Gracián it is likely that the word concepto still held the same connotations as the Latin term conceptus Blanco and FernándezCorugedo have highlighted and respectively that Gracián contemporary and fellow Jesuit priest and philosopher Francisco Suárez in his Disputationes metaphysicae comments upon the duality of the word conceptus when he writes Conceptus formalis dicitur actus ipse seu quod idem est verbum quo intellectus rem aliquam seu communem rationem concipit qui dicitur conceptus quia est veluti proles mentis formalis autem appellatur vel quia est ultima forma mentis vel quia formaliter repraesentat menti rem cognitam vel quia revera est intrinsecus et formalis terminus conceptionis mentalis in quo differt a conceptu obiectivo ut ita dicam Conceptus obiectivus dicitur res illa vel ratio quae proprie et immediate per conceptum formalem cognoscitur seu repraesentatur ut verbi gratia cum hominem concipimus ille actus quem in mente efficimus ad concipiendum hominem vocatur conceptus formalis homo autem cognitus et repraesentatus illo actu dicitur conceptus obiectivus conceptus quidem per denominationem extrinsecam a conceptu formali per quem obiectum eius concipi dicitur et ideo recte dicitur obiectivus quia non est conceptus ut forma intrinsece terminans conceptionem sed ut obiectum et materia circa quam versatur formalis conceptio et ad quam mentis acies directe tendit propter quod ab aliquibus ex Averroe intentio intellecta appellatur et ab aliis dicitur ratio obiectiva In this passage Suárez acknowledges the theoretical difference between what Parker terms the concept and the conceit while still stressing their essential unity by referring to both ideas as the conceptus formalis and the conceptus obiectivus Suárez highlights the interdependence between the conceptus formalis and the conceptus obiectivus by using the simple example of man we form our interior concept of man only thanks to our perception of man in world and this is indicative more generally of the dependence of mental activity on the exterior world At the same time the universal idea of man exists thanks to the mind ability to abstract ideas from particular examples in the exterior world to categorise them into general groups and to give these groups labels such as man As such the idea of man the conceptus formalis exists thanks to the abstraction of our interior intellect but our interior intellect only formed the idea of man thanks to the exterior existence of man the conceptus obiectivus This creates an ontological reciprocity between interiority and exteriority in which exterior existence and reality parecer are dependent upon interior conceptualisation ser and vice versa Furthermore as Suárez points out conceptus formalis dicitur actus ipse seu quod idem est verbum quo intellectus rem aliquam seu communem rationem concipit it is specifically the linguistic act of designating man as man which is synonymous with the conceptus formalis As such Suárez proposes that thought itself is linguistic meaning that there can be no stage to a thought prior to the articulation in language of that thought even if this is not outwardly verbalised Blanco teases out the consequences of this when she writes Lacte nommé concept formel par lequel le concept objectif est formé est donc identifié au mot ou à la parole Il ny a dautre acte de conception que la parole ellemême il ny a de pensée que verbalisée Cest pourquoi Gracián est en accord avec sa culture philosophique quand il définit le concepto comme acte tout en sachant bien que tout son ouvrage implique sa nature verbale Le concepto est une pensée en acte cestàdire une pensée qui résulte dun acte dexpression acte que dès sa genèse même est orienté vers cette pensée Il y a donc circularité ou impossibilité de designer quelle est le terme premier du couple Il est impossible à propos du concepto comme à propos du conceptus de séparer le moment de la pensée et celui de sa mise en forme Blanco commenting upon Suárez observations concludes that thought is verbal meaning that the concept formel is always a linguistic act which in turn means that the concept formel is the concept objectif thought is always objectified in language even if it only exists in our mind and cannot exist in any type of unobjectified form The two types of concept are therefore circular harking back to the duality of the Latin term conceptus representing both the act of containing and the thing contained a man can exist in the world of parecer but it is only via the action of the intellect which is inherently linguistic that the concept of man exists in the world of ser The realms of ser and parecer are therefore mutually and ontologically dependent and in the moment of the concepto agudeza their mutual existence is asserted This is what Andersen means when she states that agudeza the concepto and ingenio function within the remit of the relation between the realms of ser and parecer Given their contemporaneity and their shared vocation it is very likely that Gracián was familiar with Suárez works and Gracián famous definition of the concepto shares a lexical similarity which hints towards a familiarity with the Disputationes metaphysicae This definition already partially cited is rarely cited in full The full definition reads De suerte que se puede definir el concepto es un acto del entendimiento que exprime la correspondencia que se halla entre los objectos La misma consonancia o correlación artificiosa exprimida es la sutileza objectiva Like Suárez Gracián defines the concepto as un acto which expresses or wrings out la correspondencia between los objectos Noteworthy is Gracián use of the term correspondencia which encapsulates the essence of the Latin term ratio which can be translated into English as system connection or relation Gracián does not initially differentiate between the conceptus formalis and the concepto obiectivus as Suárez does However he shows his awareness of this differentiation when he states that the very consonancia o correlación is la sutileza objetiva In other words the interconnections and unexpected links the conceptus formalis that man perceives in his mind and simultaneously and inevitably expresses in language the acto during the moment of the concepto are the concepto obiectivus or ratio Just as Suárez outlines that the intentio intellecta and the ratio obiectiva are interchangeable Gracián too conflates the concepto and the agudeza the concepto is the agudeza and vice versa This adherence to Suárez ideas concerning the ontological interdependence of the conceptus formalis and the conceptus obiectivus indicates that Gracián conceptualisation of the concepto is more although not fully in line with Woods interpretation than with that of Parker while Parker temporally delineates each step in the process of the production of agudeza from the initial concept to the fullyformed conceit Woods argues that the concepto and the agudeza are simultaneous and therefore synonymous As such it follows that the kind of knowledge or insight granted by the concepto agudeza which we know to be transient aesthetic and somewhat ethereal tends to be the result of something instinctive intuitive and spontaneous rather than of a conscious rational and deliberated process This means that Gracián is proposing an approach towards epistemology which is not based upon reason or logic whilst judgement makes a choice between different options and whilst reason aggregates judgements to arrive at logical conclusions the conceptus designates the type of knowledge granted by intuition and it is to this kind of knowledge that Gracián conceptualisation of agudeza the concepto and ingenio for the most part pertains Nevertheless the text title as an Arte de ingenio suggests that there is a sense in which ingenio usually understood to be innate and unconscious can be learned honed and perfected through dedicated practice As such the interpretations of Parker and Woods although seemingly dissenting are both valid Epistemology Overcoming Scepticism ia the Universal Insight of Aesthetic Experience In discurso of the Agudeza Gracián tells the allegorical story of Verdad who was happily married to Entendimiento One day Mentira comes along and chases Verdad out of their marital bed Verdad exiled and destitute is taken under the wing of Agudeza who listens to her plight and offers a solution iéndose la Verdad despreciada y aun perseguida acogióse a la Agudeza comunicóla su trabajo y consultóla su remedio Verdad amiga dijo la Agudeza no hay manjar más desabrido en estos estragados tiempos que un desengaño a secas mas qué digo desabrido no hay bocado más amargo que una verdad desnuda La luz que derechamente hiere atormenta los ojos de una águila de un lince ¡cuánto más los que flaquean Para esto inventaron los sagaces médicos del ánimo el arte de dorar las verdades de azucarar los desengaños Quiero decir y observadme bien esta lición estimadme este consejo que os hagáis política vestíos al uso del mismo Engaño disfrazaos con sus mismos arreos que con eso yo os aseguro el remedio y aun el vencimiento When married to Entendimiento Truth and Understanding were directly associated with one another However due to the machinations of Mentira the intrinsic connection between Verdad and Entendimiento was severed As such Verdad finds herself rebutted and rejected even when in plain sight Agudeza explains to Verdad that she is unpalatable when she shows herself too directly and encourages her to adopt a disguise in order to sweeten herself Agudeza tells Verdad to use engaño in order to lead to desengaño and to manipulate her surface appearance in order to make her underlying message more digestible In other words Agudeza instructs Verdad to manipulate her parecer in order to reveal more effectively her ser Verdad comes to appreciate Agudeza advice stating Abrió los ojos la Verdad dio desde entonces en andar con artificio usa de las invenciones introdúcese por rodeos vence con estratagemas pinta lejos lo que está muy cerca habla de lo presente en lo pasado propone en aquel sujeto lo que quiere condenar en éste apunta a uno para dar en otro deslumbra las pasiones desmiente los afectos y por ingenioso circunloquio viene siempre a parar en el punto de su intención With this allegory Gracián is stressing that uncovered Truth no longer prompts immediate understanding and can no longer rely on direct perception to be believed echoing the evasiveness of Truth described by Ovid in his Metamorphoses which resulted from the decline of the human condition during its descent from Golden to Iron Age book one ll Rather Gracián writes Truth must insert herself into and conform with the realm of parecer in order for her ser to be manifest in the world This ingenioso circunloquio is the only way for Truth to be accessed once again showing that for Gracián Truth and the world form and content ser and parecer all go handinhand The belief that ser cannot be accessed without parecer and that Truth cannot be attained without some form of engaño has often been interpreted along Ovidian lines as a sign of seventeenthcentury Spain epistemological angst Robbins for example characterises the era as one suffering a crisis of knowledge in which reality is little better than an illusion if ser is always intertwined with parecer and can never be glimpsed and known in itself how is man to navigate the changeable and uncertain realm of parecer in order to access the certainty of ser If all knowledge is gleaned from the realm of parecer does that mean that all knowledge is contingent provisional and subject to constant renewal Can man ever access Truth which is universal and unchanging akin to Cartesian clear and distinct truths Or is all knowledge inevitably subject to sceptical doubt Whilst pointing out the epistemological crisis of Gracián era Robbins also highlights the positive role that agudeza can play in transcending this crisis when he states The turn of the mind which creates conceits uncovers a universe of otherwise hidden links between things The ingenio via the conceit unifies intellectually a world of otherwise disparate and distinct entitiesWit on this reading thus becomes a means of holding together a world which was increasingly falling apart Whilst many critics have focused on the uncertain Baroque world of disparate and distinct entities increasingly falling apart when interpreting Gracián works Robbins here draws attention to the constructive role that Gracián grants to ingenio and agudeza as a means via which man can overcome the confusion and uncertainty of the world The ability of man to make connections and to comprehend momentarily the harmony of the world from a universal Godlike point of view points towards an epistemological Optimism in Gracián works which is often overlooked arguably because the roles of agudeza the concepto and ingenio have not been fully understood In a similar manner to the Renaissance Neoplatonists Gracián epistemological Optimism is manifest through the way in which he proposes momentary attainment of universal insight via the particular Unlike Descartes who eschews worldly particulars due to their susceptibility to doubt Gracián follows the more optimistic Neoplatonic model which embraces particularity as the only route via which the universal can be accessed As examined in Chapter Two Castiglione in his Il libro del Cortegiano described the process by which man must abstract from a physical manifestation of beauty towards an increasingly disembodied and universal concept of Beauty after which he must then abstract from his own intellect towards the universal intellect enabling him to bask subsequently in the divine presence and to experience the clarity of universal insight However whilst replicating the Neoplatonists optimistic conceptualisation of worldly particulars Gracián achieves universal insight in a slightly different way Ingenio for Gracián does not abstract from something which is already in existence towards a universal concept of this thing and eventually towards the divine As the roots of Gracián thinking in the work of Francisco Suárez indicate the moment in which ingenio functions sees the simultaneous creation of both concept and thing conceived bringing into existence the conceptus or the concepto agudeza Furthermore while Suárez uses the simple example of man to exemplify the interdependence of the conceptus formalis and the conceptus obiectiva his conflation of the conceptus obiectivus with the ratio obiectiva shows that like Gracián he too conceptualises the conceptus not only as a discrete entity which objectively and physically exists such as man a horse the colour yellow or the number four Blanco but also as a more abstract and intangible system of connections This correspondencia as Gracián terms it does not exist for man in the same way that a horse or a man does However this does not mean to say that it does not exist at all either formally or objectively Rather the correspondencia representing an insight into the interconnectedness of the world exists in another form in the mind of God The moment in which the concepto agudeza is perceived articulated therefore represents a brief moment of universal insight This makes it fleeting and transient but it also grants it a seraphic intensity as the perceiver is absorbed in the simultaneous perception and articulation of a correspondencia which bestows upon him an ethereal understanding of the interconnectedness of the world as if from a divine and universal point of view This is undoubtedly what Sarmiento had in mind when he described exalted moods of apprehension where consciousness floats on the high seas of complete understanding Unlike Descartes who searches for universal and unchanging Truth in man interiority a defining characteristic of Gracián version of universal insight is the necessity of its constant reconfiguration and regeneration man cannot perceive the universal permanently because being able to do so would make him divine However he does have the ability using ingenio to reconfigure repeatedly his perception of the world in order to reignite his awareness of the universal and of divinity Due to its inherent circumstantiality and changeability HidalgoSerna describes the action of ingenio as un modo de filosofar que parte de lo individual y concreto and in direct contrast to the Cartesian approach as un método de conocimiento no racional Perceptionarticulation of the concepto agudeza does not typically occur in a rational way which makes it a difficult process upon which to theorise conclusively Blanco hits upon this difficulty when she describes the perceptionarticulation of the concepto agudeza as non plus métaphysique mais poétique highlighting the way in which Gracián notion of epistemological Truth does not align itself with the universal Truth usually reached through traditional philosophical reasoning and is rather closely aligned with the sudden and temporary access to universality granted by aesthetic experience As outlined in the previous chapter the seeds of this conflation of epistemological Truth insight into the universal and aesthetic experience were planted in Gracián very first work El Héroe In this text Gracián stressed the complementarity of both juicio and ingenio showing them to be mutually committed to the endeavour of gaining understanding meaning that they both carry an epistemological function However whilst juicio was taken to be synonymous with reason as this term was usually understood at the time as the spark of the divine left within man after the Fall which grants him access to indubitable and objective truths in his interiority through the process of synderesis ingenio on the other hand was shown to designate a different type of reason in El Héroe Gracián outlined the way in which ingenio is intertwined with gusto taste a concept usually confined to the realm of aesthetics By describing ingenio whose epistemological role had already been established as pleito ante el tribunal del gusto I Gracián succeeded in El Héroe in intertwining ingenio and gusto understanding and beauty and epistemology and aesthetics This intertwining briefly articulated in the earlier work comes to the fore in the Agudeza In discurso of this later text for example Gracián discourages the reader from trying to define something as intangible as agudeza stating déjase percibir no definir y en tan remoto asunto estímese cualquiera descripción lo que es para los ojos la hermosura y para los oídos la consonancia eso es para el entendimiento el concepto Here Gracián overtly tells his readers to refrain from trying to theorise rationally upon the concepto agudeza and to instead déjase percibir indicating that this perception will come without purposeful instigation He also draws a comparison between the sensual faculties of sight and sound and the intellect and connects the intellectual satisfaction which results from the concepto to the aesthetic satisfaction which results from visual beauty and musical harmony The intellect is therefore shown to function like the other senses using exterior experience about which Descartes was so sceptical as the base upon which to work towards the perceptionarticulation of aesthetic beauty and harmony and upon which to gain universal insight As such a link is overtly established between the concepto agudeza aesthetic experience and understanding of the universal Ayala Martínez articulates this when he states that para Gracián el mundo es un reflejo de la inteligencia divina en consecuencia la verdad y la belleza andan unidas y son para el hombre una fuente inagotable de sentido Este mundo cualitativo sólo el ingenio es capaz de desvelarlo The unique ability of ingenio to reach this state of aesthetic rapture is stressed when Gracián states later in the same discurso that no se contenta el ingenio con solo la verdad como el juicio sino que aspira a la hermosura Both juicio and ingenio seek la verdad but only for ingenio is hermosura a prerequisite for it to be perceivedarticulated Whilst Gracián briefly introduced his conceptualisation of gusto in his first work El Héroe we also saw in the previous chapter his development of this concept in El Discreto In this text Gracián explained that siempre va el gusto en adelante nunca vuelve atrás no se ceba en lo que ya pasó siempre pica en la novedad and remarked that vese esto más en los empleos del ingenio que aunque sean cosas muy sabidas si el modo del decirlas en el retórico y del escribirlas en el historiador fuere nuevo las hace apetecibles As such Gracián expresses the idea that gusto once accomplished is never satisfied and it is the task of ingenio to revive and regenerate cosas muy sabidas in such a way as to render them once again apetecibles Ingenio therefore functions to recombine facets which are already well known in order to rereveal the truths inherent in them and to continually regenerate novelty which leads to a kind of admiración which is akin to aesthetic rapture Unlike juicio which reveals atemporal and objective universal truths the universality revealed by ingenio is transient and requires constant renewal and this renewal in its dependence on contrived reconfiguration is necessarily artificial in contrast to the connotations of instinct and intuition that the word ingenio usually carries Gracián links the action of ingenio to art and artifice in the Agudeza when he writes in discurso Toda potencia intencional del alma digo las que perciben objectos gozan de algún artificio en ellos la proporción entre las partes del visible es la hermosura entre los sonidos la consonancia que hasta el vulgar gusto halla combinación entre lo picante y suave entre lo dulce y lo agrio El entendimiento pues como primera y principal potencia álzase con la prima del artificio con lo estremado del primor en todas sus diferencias de objectos Destínanse las artes a estos artificios que para su composición fueron inventadas adelantando siempre y facilitando su perfección Here Gracián again makes a connection between sensual and intellectual satisfaction connecting the visual hermosura of something symmetrical musical consonancia and the delight of harmonious flavours in the mouth with the intellectual satisfaction which can come via entendimiento He therefore once again links sense experience and the intellect via their shared goal of attaining a state of aesthetic rapture However whilst perception of the aesthetic is usually taken to be something intuitive and spontaneous an instinctual elevation of man consciousness towards the divine Gracián here describes elevation towards the aesthetic as something more deliberated he refers to man potencia intencional which builds upon the foundation of artificio he describes the objects which the senses perceive in terms of their artificial proporción combinación and composición he states that entendimiento elevates itself con la prima del artificio and he describes the way in which las artes were inventadas for estos artificios with the aim of adelantando siempre y facilitando su perfección The function of ingenio is therefore to perceive and more imperatively to reconfigure and to reperceive the connections which can be made between things on the plane of the intellect in the same way that we can find visual symmetry look for aural rhythms and notice patterns in taste which go beyond those which are immediately obvious The necessity that man repeatedly and artificially regenerate aesthetic admiración using his ingenio in order to renew and refresh his consciousness of the interconnectedness and harmoniousness of God creation is paradoxical and it is this paradox which is encapsulated in the text title aesthetic rapture is usually conceptualised as a state which overcomes and overwhelms the consumer of a piece of art without conscious volition However in the Agudeza Gracián is outlining his belief that man must purposefully and artificially cultivate this state of aesthetic rapture by adopting a way of being in the world which actively seeks to perceive connections with the inevitable consequence that these connections become more and more unexpected novel witty and bedazzling As such Gracián encourages an approach towards the world which reconciles the interpretations of Parker and Woods after man initial novelty towards the world has worn off he must work to reproduce this novelty via artificial means perceiving and articulating the concepto and agudeza using the rationalised and temporalised process outlined by Parker Once man has become proficient in this practice he will begin to implement it without conscious effort at which point the action of ingenio and the production of the concepto agudeza becomes spontaneous and it is then that man ingenio reaches its perfection a product of intuition and instinct rather than of reason and logic Gracián exemplifies this refinement of ingenio through the characters of Critilo and Andrenio in El Criticón and this process will be analysed in the following chapter of El Criticón Andrenio Contemplation of the Stars and Critilo Explanation of Ingenio In order to follow Critilo and Andrenio gradual refinement of their ingenio from a faculty which must be implemented in a contrived artificial and rationalised fashion to a faculty which implements itself intuitively and spontaneously an analysis of the entirety of El Criticón is necessary which will be carried out in the following chapter Nevertheless a brief analysis of El gran teatro del Universo allows us to apprehend generally the way in which Gracián conceptualisation of ingenio works In this crisi Andrenio describes the way in which he was freed from the cave in which he had hitherto been trapped on the Isla Santa Elena thanks to an earthquake and his feelings when discovering the world for the first time Upon doing so Andrenio is nearly immobilised by admiración for everything he sees representing the initial amazement and ease with which man can come to an awareness of the glory of the world and of the divine Dazzled by this glory Andrenio attention turns towards the source of it towards God who is represented by the sun as per this scene antecedent in Plato Allegory of the Cave However Andrenio swiftly turns his attention away from the sun and towards the variety and novelty of the night sky Whilst admiring these qualities he questions why God did not arrange the stars in the sky with uniformity as would usually be expected from an allpowerful creator It is at this point that Critilo explains to Andrenio the way in which the varied and changeable dispersion of the stars in the night sky enables man to make diverse connections which allow the glory of God to be revealed in many different ways As such thanks to variety and changeability represented here by the fluctuating stars of the night sky man initial admiración when faced with the glory of the world does not wane and via the implementation of ingenio can be repeatedly refreshed and regenerated throughout his life This crisi of El Criticón is an important one not just because it contains the scene in which Critilo explains to Andrenio the way in which ingenio works but also because it has frequently been used by critics to argue that Gracián dismisses the possibility of a divine creator which upon close reading is clearly shown to be an erroneous conclusion Forcione highlighted that this crisi takes direct inspiration from Fray Luis de Granada hexameral narrative Introducción del símbolo de la fe Hexameral texts typically assert the divine origins of the world by describing the way in which the rational language of the book of the world can be read to reveal God as creator Such texts assert the cosmic connection between God and man via the shared faculty of rationality Andrenio observation that the stars in the night sky are not dispersed in a uniform fashion has been read as a negation of God rationality and as proof that Gracián fails to perceive the existence of a rational creator from the evidence supplied by an irrational and disordered world representing a purposeful rupture of the chain of communication between God and man usually espoused by hexameral texts Forcione calls this scene a parody of Pico della Mirandola Oration on the Dignity of Man arguing that the cosmic disconnection between man the world and God that it depicts forces man into the necessity of sculpting himself He interprets the scene as symptomatic of a chaotic reality and argues that Gracián presents a new condition of man as a distanced being separated from the traditional cosmos which had offered a reassuring model for his identity as coequal with creator and created order in their shared rationality Forcione accurately highlights that Gracián breaks the bounds of reason which have traditionally tied man to God However his error lies in interpreting this rupture negatively For Gracián the idea that man and God share the same faculty of rationality is impossible because man is not divine and can never hope to achieve the same cognitive abilities as God Rather Gracián posits an alternative form of reason ingenio which does not grant man understanding of the divine but which does allow him to perceive the immensity and perfection of that which he does not understand leading to a kind of insight into the universal which does not aspire towards an understanding of it of El Criticón begins with Andrenio description of his initial sense of admiración upon entering the world for the first time Critilo then expresses his nostalgia for this feeling explaining that as the world becomes more familiar it loses its novelty and its ability to spark such a reaction He states Oh lo que te invidio tanta felicidad no imaginada privilegio único del primer hombre y tuyo llegar a ver con novedad y con advertencia la grandeza la hermosura el concierto la firmeza y la variedad desta gran máquina criada Fáltanos la admiración comúnmente a nosotros porque falta la novedad y con ésta la advertencia Entramos todos en el mundo con los ojos del ánimo cerrados y cuando los abrimos al conocimiento ya la costumbre de ver las cosas por maravillosas que sean no dexa lugar a la admiración Por esso los varones sabios se valieron siempre de la reflexión imaginándose llegar de nuevo al mundo reparando en sus prodigios que cada cosa lo es admirando sus perfecciones y filosofando artificiosamente When a being such as el primer hombre a tabula rasa or a noble savage figure enters the world the novedad grandeza hermosura concierto firmeza and variedad of creation are immediately able to elevate his mind towards contemplation of the interconnectedness of the gran máquina criada towards the beauty and harmony of the totality of God creation As he becomes more accustomed to the world man loses his advertencia existing con los ojos del ánimo cerrados To combat this and to reignite his sense of wonder man must change his costumbre de ver las cosas imagining himself arriving de nuevo al mundo and enabling him to reflect upon sus prodigios and sus perfecciones in a more deliberated and contrived way filosofando artificiosamente After describing his initial awe towards the wonder of the world Andrenio next describes the way in which his mind turned towards the source of this wonder towards God symbolised by the sun representing man tendency to strive towards an epistemological certainty which is beyond his reach man can never obtain permanent access to the divine because this type of universal understanding is simply beyond his station as a human being Andrenio calls the sun esse gran monarca de la luz and the symbolism inherent in it is confirmed when Critilo describes the sun as la criatura que más ostentosamente retrata la magestuosa grandeza del Criador Andrenio recalls the way in which his curiosity towards the sun grew into an obsession stating todo el día empleé en él contemplándose ya en sí ya en los reflexos de las aguas olvidado de mí mismo which culminates with his lament Mas ay que al uso de acá baxo la grandeza de mi contento se convirtió presto en un exceso de pesar al ver digo al no verle trocóse la alegría del nacer en el horror del morir el trono de la mañana en el túmulo de la noche sepultóse el sol en las aguas y quedé yo anegado en otro mar de mi llanto Creí no verle más con que quedé muriendo Andrenio natural curiosity towards the sunGod soon turns into un exceso de pesar in which la alegría del nacer becomes el horror del morir We therefore see that excessive contemplation of the source of creation instead of simply enjoying this creation turns la mañana into la noche by becoming excessively fixated with the idea of God man innocent curiosity and epistemological potential is darkened as he ends up muriendo and with nothing but llanto upon realising the impossibility of attaining the type of knowledge to which he aspires This scene antecedent in Plato Allegory of the Cave confirms the deduction that Andrenio yearning for the sun signifies a desire to possess knowledge of an unknowable force which Plato conceptualises as the Idea of the Good and which Gracián conceptualises as the Christian God Just as the reality of the people chained in Plato cave was a product of the fire forming shadows against the cave wall the sun also forges our reality in the same way The inhabitants of Plato cave were unable to see behind the fire just as we can never fully conceptualise the sunGod man must simply accept reality for what it appears to be and live in it without superior insight As FernándezCorugedo states such insight nos produciría un estado de éxtasis permanente arrancándonos de este mundo Andrenio obsession with the sun his inability to think of anything else and his panic as it set every evening represents an unhealthy fixation with the unknowable and a desire to understand the world in a way which is beyond man cognitive abilities Through Andrenio obsession with the sun Gracián depicts man tendency to yearn towards unknowable knowledge However Gracián also depicts Andrenio innate ability to set aside these epistemological aspirations which he does by shifting his attention towards contemplation of the night sky stating pero volví presto a resucitar entre nuevas admiraciones a un cielo coronado de luminarias haziendo fiesta a mi contento Assigúrote que no me fue menos agradable vista ésta antes más entretenida cuanto más varia Andrenio describes the way in which the variety of un cielo coronado de luminarias the stars sparking in the darkness of the night sky provoked for him just as much contento as the stable and uniform brightness of the sun and indeed points out that the night sky was all the more agradable thanks to this variety and changeability He goes on to remark En lo que yo mucho reparé fue en su maravillosa disposición Porque ya que el soberano Artífice hermoseó tanto esta artesonada bóveda del mundo con tanto florón y estrella por qué no las dispusso dezía yo con orden y concierto de modo que entretexieran vistosos lazos y formaran primorosas labores No sé cómo me lo diga ni cómo lo declare Whilst conceding that the variety of the night sky was pleasing to him describing its maravillosa disposición Andrenio expresses surprise that el soberano Artífice God decided to distribute the stars without orden y concierto explaining that he expected a divine creator to distribute them with more formal regularity and symmetry in such a way that they formed vistosos lazos and primorosas labores Critilo is then able to demonstrate to Andrenio the way in which variety and changeability allow access to universal insight on the plane of the intellect via the implementation of ingenio He explains that formal uniformity en forma ya de un artificioso recamado ya de un vistoso jardín ya de un preciosso joyel pertains simply to surface appearances and that whilst this may be visually and sensually pleasing it fails to elevate man intellect towards consciousness of the universal and the divine He states Reparas bienpero advierte que la divina sabiduría que las formó y las repartió las estrellas desta suerte atendió a otra más importante correspondencia cual lo es la de sus movimientos y aquel templarse las influencias Porque has de saber que no hay astro alguno en el cielo que no tenga su diferente propriedad assí como las yerbas y las plantas de la tierra unas de las estrellas causan el calor otras el frío unas secan otras humedecen y desta suerte alternan otras muchas influencias y con essa essencial correspondencia unas a otras se corrigen y se templan La otra disposición artificiosa que tú dizes fuera afectada y uniforme quédese para los juguetes del arte y de la humana niñería Deste modo se nos haze cada noche nuevo el cielo y nunca enfada el mirarlo cada uno proporciona las estrellas como quiere a más de que en esta variedad natural y confusión grave parecen tanto más que el vulgo las juzga inumerables y con esto queda como en enigma la suprema assistencia si bien para los sabios muy clara y entendida Critilo explains that a disposición artificiosa such as that of a carefully embroidered tapestry an artfully sculpted garden or a scrupulously crafted jewel is para los juguetes del arte y de la humana niñería indicating that things which show an attractive surface appearance should not be venerated simply because their parecer is visually pleasing to and conceptualisable by man Rather what is more worthy of the attention of the intellect is the correspondencia to be discerned between things which functions below the surface in the realm of ser In the case of the stars discerning this correspondencia involves becoming aware of the laws which dictate a star movimientos and of the influencias which decide why a star is the way it is a certain temperature for example Critilo explains that all stars as well as the rest of God creation such as las yerbas y las plantas have their own unique diferente propriedad and all play complementary roles within a balanced and harmonious larger whole Beyond surface appearances God creation exists in adelicate balance and it is through the perception of the hidden laws essa essencial correspondencia which maintain this delicate balance that man is able to elevate his intellect towards admiración aesthetic rapture and temporary insight into the universal Whilst the stars enter man intellect visually via their parecer it is the job of ingenio firstly to assimilate this surface appearance and then secondly to make connections between the stars which go beyond their surface appearance confirming Andersen assertion that ingenio concerns itself with the realm of ser as well as with the link between the realms of ser and parecer However whilst parecer provides a relatively objective source for man to assimilate his assimilation of this source and his synthesis of it through his intellect will always be subjective For this reason Critilo states that cada uno proporciona las estrellas como quiere In other words each individual implements ingenio differently meaning that the possible resulting correspondencias and conceptos agudezas will be particular to each individual what is important is not so much the concepto agudeza itself but that the concepto agudeza affords man a glimpse into the interconnectedness of the world and that this subsequently succeeds in elevating his intellect and in granting it insight into the universal The inherent subjectivity of ingenio combined with the changeability and variety of the world to the extent that Critilo points out that se nos haze cada noche nuevo el cielo y nunca enfada el mirarlo means that it is impossible to theorise conclusively on how agudeza the concepto and ingenio function It is for this reason that Blanco describes trying to classify the different types of agudeza as like trying to group them together comme les étoiles en constellationsThe essentially arbitrary nature of ingenio was exacerbated by Gracián through the purposefully indeterminate and infinitely proliferating categorisations of agudeza outlined in discurso I of the Agudezawhich provided little clarity as to the structure of the work to follow Just as ingenio must reconfigure haphazard elements such as stars in the sky in order to bring about a sense of artificial coherence such as a neat stellar constellation which then leads to a kind of comprehension in the form of aesthetic rapture Gracián reader must work individually to synthesise the diverse discursos of the Agudeza itself in order to attain clarity The Agudeza therefore continues a technique of formal heterogeneity and arguably incoherence which began with the miscellaneous primores of El Héroe the variegating realces of El Discreto and the disparate aphorisms of the Oráculo The image of an infinite number of haphazardlyordered stars in the night sky is one which Gracián evidently considered apposite using it both in El Criticón and elsewhere to represent the apparently chaotic variety of the world and the necessity that ingenio forge connections between the seemingly disparate elements within creation The seeds of the scene in which Andrenio contemplates the disorder of the stars and Critilo explains the way in which ingenio works are sewn throughout the Agudeza where Gracián makes repeated references to the stars the firmament and the constellations For example in discurso he states La uniformidad limita la variedad dilata y tanto es más sublime cuanto más nobles perfecciones multiplica No brillan tantos astros en el firmamento campean flores en el prado cuantas se alternan sutilezas en una fecunda inteligencia IHere Gracián explicitly points out the superiority of la variedad over la uniformidad stating that the latter limits whilst the former opens up possibility and argues that the more varied and apparently chaotic the world is and the more perfecciones which exist within it the more sublime it is He also confirms that proliferation is a mark of ingenio when he states that una fecunda inteligencia can produce more sutilezas than there are astros en el firmamento or flores en el prado Whilst stressing the insuperable creative powers of ingenio Gracián sees a fitting reflection of its creative and regenerative abilities in the image of a seemingly infinite number of stars populating the firmament Elsewhere in discurso I of the Agudeza Gracián again uses the image of stars in the sky to demonstrate the way in which ingenio works in relation to what he classifies as agudeza compuesta He states La agudeza compuesta consta de muchos actos y partes principales si bien se unen en la moral y artificiosa trabazón de un discurso Cada piedra de las preciosas tomada de por sí pudiera oponerse a estrella pero muchas juntas en un joyel parece que pueden emular el firmamento composición artificiosa del ingenio en que se erige máquina sublime no de columnas ni arquitrabes sino de asuntos y de conceptos IGracián here describes the way in which un discurso is made up of muchos actos y partes principales which are woven together in an artificiosa trabazón to form a longer and more complex piece of writing Each one of these actos y partes is like a piedra de las preciosas or an estrella in the night sky beautiful in themselves but even more beautiful when they interconnect with other components and make up a larger trabazón whether that be un discurso in relation to words un joyel in relation to precious stones or el firmamento in relation to stars This trabazón the web of connections forged between components is the composición artificiosa del ingenio via which man can gain a consciousness of the interconnectedness of the máquina sublime not simply visually but on the plane of asuntos yconceptos Although the world may appear chaotic to man it is perfect and has a coherence which lies beyond his cognitive abilities The function of ingenio is to connect what appear to be chaotic components into a trabazón of connections from which the order inherent within the apparent disorder of creation can be temporarily and transiently glimpsed the only form of universal insight of which man is capable Towards the end ofof El Criticón Critilo reflects upon Andrenio fixation with the sun representing the tendency of man to yearn towards perfect insight pero lo más digno de notarse es que assí como el sol es claro espejo de Dios y de sus divinos atributos la luna lo es del hombre y de sus humanas imperfeccionesAs such Critilo confirms Gracián belief that man has limited epistemological potential and that the clarity afforded to the sunGod will never be within his grasp However he also points out that the night sky characterised by changeability and inconstancy represented here by the waxing and waning of the moon is where man epistemological potential can be realised The necessity of variety for man cognitive abilities to function is also expressed in the Agudeza again using the symbolism of the night sky Gracián writes in discurso Puédese decir de los conceptos lo que de las figuras retóricas ni todo el cielo es estrellas ni todo el cielo es vacíos sirven éstos como de fondos para que campeen más los altos de aquéllas y altérnanse las sombras para que brillan más las luces For los conceptos to occur the sky can neither be composed completely of stars which would be akin to perfect insight nor can it be completely empty which would be akin to no insight at all t is precisely the mix of las sombras and las luces represented by the light of the stars and the moon within the void of the night sky that affords man the possibility to make connections and to reach a kind of insight into the universal which is fitting to his station For this reason variety and apparent disorder are prerequisites for ingenio to function and for it to contrive an arbitrary sense of coherence from a world which is fundamentally beyond man understanding The connections that man makes and the conceptosagudezas which he produces are less important than his very ability to make them creating constellations from the stars for example is an arbitrary process producing no formal or physical product which can be recommenced at any time from any starting point As such Gracián does not champion the concepto agudeza so much as our inexhaustible ability to create them and to use them to see order within disorder ie the act of creating the concepto agudeza the acto del entendimiento as per his definition of the concepto in discursoof the Agudeza From these brief examples it is evident that the seeds of the type of ingenio expounded in El Criticón were present in Gracián mind during the production of the Agudeza As the Agudeza lack of popularity suggests this conceptualisation of ingenio was arguably expressed in a more engaging way through the use of narrative fiction The points at which the Agudeza is most engaging tend to be the points at which it corresponds most closely to the form and content of El Criticón For example when Gracián uses the image of the stars in the night sky to expound his conceptualisation of ingenio as has been examined in this section but also during many other points of alignment when Gracián speaks about the figure of Momo in discursos and when he references the philosophy of Seneca Socrates and Diogenes in discursos and when he addresses paradoxes such as that between life and death in discursowhen he questions the nature of man and his place in the world in discursos and and most notably when he writes in allegorical form in discursos and As analysed in more detail in the following chapter Andersen has examined the Spanish tendency to philosophise via narrative fiction rather than via philosophical treatiseRobbins and it seems that El Criticón succeeds where the Agudeza fails in this respect the Agudeza is not a work of fiction but nor is it a treatise on rhetoric or a purely philosophical tract There is a sense in which Gracián was already aware of the superiority of the fictionalised allegorical form for his subject matter he writes in his Al lector to the Agudeza that pudiera haber dado a este volumen la forma de alguna alegoríaand he repeatedly points out the merits of narrative fiction and allegory throughout the work see for example discursos and As such although the Agudeza is the text within which Gracián sets out to theorise upon agudeza the concepto and ingenio it is only with the publication of El Criticón that these elements of his philosophy come to be demonstrated in a more clear and engaging way Conclusion Gracián ideas of agudeza the concepto and ingenio carry ramifications for almost every branch of his philosophical thought this chapter has shown the way in which Gracián definition of the concepto aligns it with the idea of the conceptus The ontological consequence of this is that existence in the realms of ser and parecer are mutually dependent neither is able to exist without the other and there can be no being without beingintheworld Andersen The epistemological consequence of this is that objective knowledge ser unfiltered by the world parecer is not possible the only kind of insight into the universal that man can hope to attain is in the form of temporary and transient aesthetic experience which must be continually renewed and refreshed The way in which man experiences this insight into the universal is the biggest source of disagreement amongst critics does admiración strike man intuitively instinctively and spontaneously without conscious effort on his part or is man able to provoke the feeling of aesthetic rapture in a more deliberated artificial and contrived way through a rationalised process Whilst Woods argues for the former and Parker argues for the latter this chapter has broadly argued for a reconciliation between these two interpretations as hinted by the text seemingly paradoxical title as an Arte de ingenio first man must train his faculty of ingenio through deliberated practice then ingenio will begin to create conceptosagudezas in a more unconscious fashion Whilst this shift from practice to perfection is not articulated with clarity within the Agudeza it is demonstrated clearly within El Criticón in which Gracián extends the remit of ingenio from ontology epistemology and aesthetics to incorporate the philosophical branch of morality as examined in the following chapter which will demonstrate the way in which Gracián conceptualises prudence as a form of ingenio The ontological dependence that the Agudeza outlines between the idea in the mind the concepto and the manifestation of this idea in the world the agudeza carries consequences for Aquinas assertion that prudence must incorporate both deliberation and action just as the concepto must become manifest in the world via an agudeza and just as ingenio can be perfected through practice prudence too must be manifest in the world through action and also reaches its perfection when implemented unconsciously through intuition and instinct Despite the consistently positive framing of ingenio within Gracián work critics such as Forcione have interpreted it pessimistically as a necessary byproduct of a shifting reality in which reason has been toppled from its throne uncertainty is rife and in which ser can never be accessed directly On the other hand critics such as Blanco HidalgoSerna and Woods rightfully assert that this mourning of reason represents le goût enfantin des hommes pour leffet décoratif de la régularité offering the alternative interpretation in line with Gracián that cest le désordre qui rend la beauté du ciel inépuisable puisquil donne à celui qui le contemple la liberté dy inventer un nombre indéfini de configurations toujours nouvelles BlancoThe connections forged by ingenio may be largely arbitrary but they enable man to grant order to God infinite variety whilst remaining a distinctly finite being which makes up part of that variety Man will never be able to conceptualise the universe in its totality but he is able to anchor himself in a fixed position from which he can conceptualise a small portion of it n other words objective and atemporal universal knowledge is not a possibility but temporary insight into the universal via the rapture of aesthetic experience is within man remit
