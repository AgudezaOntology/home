Concept and Conceit An Aspect of Comparative Literary History It is a signal honour that you have done me in electing me President of the Modern Humanities Research Association and I must express my deep gratitude for being added to the list of distinguished scholars When asked to name a subject for the Presidential Address I proposed one that would enable me to complete research that I had already begun But before this had been taken much further my eyesight suddenly failed leaving me unable to read I have had to depend entirely on the help of my wife relatives and friends who are acknowledged in the first note to this paper In view of the impossibility of completing the research and the difficulty of composing this address much of what I have to say will be tentative only If it deserves consideration it will require confirmation correction or refutation When I proposed the subject I was not aware that Professor Limentani had spoken about the same period but although I do refer to the Italian Seicento I shall not overlap in any respect with his theme He traced the evolution of taste from condemnation of the Baroque to sympathetic understanding and qualified admiration As regards Spanish literature this change of taste can now be taken for granted Though an age of political and economic decline the seventeenth century is the culminating period of Spain s Golden Age The greatness of such typically Baroque writers as G ngora Quevedo Gracian and Calderon is beyond dispute The rise and fall of Italian and Spanish literatures do not coincide chronologically The revaluation of Gongora followed very soon after the revaluation of the English metaphysical poets but whereas interest in the English poets centred in their conceits interest in Gongora was confined at first to his culteranismo which was considered to be a rich and sensuous poetic style The exploration of the English Metaphysical conceit was found so fascinating that English speaking scholars began around to see that Spanish conceptismo was an equally impressive and rewarding field In one respect it was more rewarding since it possessed a remarkable treatise on the conceit Wit and the Art of the Mind by Baltasar Gracian first version second version  This difficult and sometimes puzzling work has continued to be a source of fascination which despite the praise given to it by Curtius was virtually limited to English speaking scholars with the critical literature on the conceit behind them Why this should be so has prompted the investigation I shall now initiate I am not going to talk about Baroque literature in general or its philosophical or its socio economic backgrounds but only about the conceit I take it for granted that this literary phenomenon can be at its best a remarkable vehicle for deep poetical thought and feeling in close association After writing about Spanish conceptismo at various times since I began to enquire into its background I discovered that the literary history of the conceit was incomplete and as regards Spain unsatisfactory and even inaccurate I discovered also to my surprise that this was very largely a question of terminology and especially the difference between English critical idiom and that of other languages In literary history and criticism English has two terms which cannot be translated by a single word in the languages of Western Europe The first is romance as distinct from novel the second is conceit as distinct from concept By creating a generic distinction where only a specific one was required the term romance I would hold when used outside the medieval period has not helped to clarify the history of prose fiction The statement that Don Quijote is a romance not a novel cannot be translated without paraphrase nor is it one that nowadays makes significant sense On the other hand I always thought until I began to ponder on the subject of this address that English speaking critics had a great advantage over their continental colleagues in possessing the term conceit where Italian and Spanish have to use their forms of concept where French has to use the Italian word and where German has no recognized equivalent at all I shall suggest that this may have been unfortunate for comparative literature Baroque Wit denotes the agility of the intellect or liveliness of fancy that could see remote relationships of ideas and objects that could discern similarity in dissimilars or unity in contradiction or reality as paradoxical and so on Preoccupation with paradox and a search for the coincidence of opposites are marks of Renaissance neo Platonism an intellectual world with which Wit has rightly been associated Begging the question of terminology for the moment the fullest development of Wit is represented by the conceit which emerges in the last two decades of the sixteenth century Like some other critical terms conceit has been so vaguely used in the past that it was often difficult to know what it meant in a particular context Although the term Petrarchan conceit is still used clearly defined by its qualification conceit by itself seems now to be restricted to one meaning it is associated with metaphor or simile and with metaphor as insight not ornament Thus Dame Helen Gardner s definition A conceit is a comparison whose ingenuity is more striking than its justness All comparisons discover likeness in things unlike a comparison becomes a conceit when we are made to concede likeness while being strongly conscious of unlikeness Ruthven emphasizes the exclusiveness of this modern sense and its importance for the history of literature as follows Instead of [like Aristotle] dissociating the perceptual from the ornamental we have separated the functional from the decorative metaphysical conceits from sonneteering conceits the unconventional from the trite the seventeenth century from the sixteenth great rooted blossoms from flowers stuck in sand It is impressively tidy and schematic and perhaps even accurate What is amazing is that we have been able to create an influential critical principle as well as a literary historical concept of period out of what was merely a rhetorical distinction in antiquity between the act of thinking and the expression of thought The word conceit is certainly a valuable analytical tool but the main aim of this address is to suggest that it can be confusing to use it as a literary historical term Ruthven himself states that the Italian concetto and the Spanish concepto meant much more than the modern conceit yet every English speaking critic has rendered concetto and concepto as conceit in this literary historical context Weinberg does this consistently thoughout his History of Literary Criticism in the Italian Renaissance though this does not reach the seventeenth century Gracian s concepto is always translated as conceit Curtius in his section on Gracian used the word Sinnspiel with concepto in brackets beside it his English translator renders this as conceit though a play on meanings is not characteristic of the great majority of Gracian s conceptos All Gracian s English speaking expositors Hispanists as well as non Hispanists Edward Sarmiento T E May S L Bethell and J A Mazzeo always use conceit Mazzeo stated that conceit and metaphor are synonymous in both the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries which is not true of either Bethell translated as conceit not only Gracian s concepto but also his agudeza which begged the whole question of terminology Scholars of English literature like Ruthven have failed to find in Gracian a satisfactory definition of conceit which they had been led to expect Spanish critics also assuming that concepto means a far fetched comparison do not seem to have found themselves at home in Gracian s Wit and the Art ofthe Mind It is noteworthy that only English speakers with the term conceit at their command have tackled this work with any confidence This identification of concetto concepto with conceit far from clarifying literary history has led to several surprising statements Curtius calls attention to what he considered the earliest collection of concetti conceptos Sinnspiele a work entitled Concetti divinissimi published in Venice in written by Girolamo Garimberto Curtius notes that the Preface defines concetto as l acutezza di un bel detto and although Battaglia s Dictionary gives this as the authority for defining concetto as a witty statement at this early period there is in fact nothing either witty or pointed in any of its contents nor anything phrased particularly elegantly It is a series of useful hints how to excuse oneself for not having answered a letter how to refuse a request politely how to send sympathy to someone who finds himself imprisoned Concetti here obviously mean thoughts for special occasions the divinissimi of the title merely praises them as fine ones Lucien Paul Thomas in I stated that the dialogue Del concetto poetico by Camillo Pellegrino was the first theoretical treatise on conceptismo and it is still generally presented as the first attempt to analyse the conceit But he thought that this was so because it was the first work that signified this theme in its title It had been preceded in I by the Avvertimenti nel poetare by Giulio Cortese who gives a rather clearer notion of concetto He distinguishes three important elements in poetry the concetti the words and the sounds The concetti are thus the soul of poetry poetic genres that do not contain any for example narrative poetry do not deserve the name of poetry a distinction is thus made between ideas on the one hand and facts descriptions and feelings on the other It is thus necessary that the poet be erudite In the debates on the Divine Comedy the concetti always meant Dante s ideas Yet despite these very clear indications Weinberg when not using the Italian word always refers to concetto as conceit With this change of emphasis away from imitation and decorum of diction towards intellectual content the problem now facing literary theorists was how to express in suitable words the ideas that were proper to poetry This is basically the subject dealt with by Camillo Pellegrino in the dialogue Del concetto poetico in which Marino appears as one of the interlocutors Concetti are a poet s thoughts these being formed in his mind as images or resemblances of real things He considers that the invention of concetti is analogous to the invention of a plot presenting objects and actions to the mind s eye Ideas are given poetic form by such figures as parallelism antithesis and chiasmus This last statement brings us close to the subject of Wit or acutezza Torquato Tasso has the same notion of concetto but he emphasizes the imaginative and sensuous aspects more than the intellectual Concetti he says are the images we form in the mind of the objects outside us In our minds they do not have the solid consistency that they possess in reality but they do have an existence proper to themselves as they are given shape by our imaginations these images being as varied as the varying imaginations of men This notion of a concetto is central to all Tasso s aesthetic doctrine According to Ulrich Leo Tasso does not yet represent the seventeenth century because his imagery is bound to sensuous experience of the real world and not to the experience of language in an elaborate exploration of words All this from Garimberto to Tasso belongs to the realm of concept and not to that of conceit as the term is now used In fact it is not easy to see how it belongs to the realm of conceit in any of its earlier senses The constant use of conceit in this connexion has therefore been very misleading Conceits had already appeared in the poetry of Marino before i but literary theory had not yet caught up with them Only the emphasis on the images of poetry marked the semantic progress from the time of Dante who in the Convivio had used it in the sense of a concept formulated either in writing or in speech The eighth acceptation in Battaglia s Dictionary introduces the conceit Rhetori cal figure especially metaphorical ingenious and subtle frequently affected and forced which surprises by its cleverness and the audacity of the comparisons it establishes especially in Baroque literature Examples to illustrate this are taken from Tasso Giordano Bruno and Boccalini these do not support the definition This is in accordance with the scholars I have so far relied on Battaglia adds another authority Tesauro who is much later in date and whose work does cover the conceit Sometime between Camillo Pellegrino s dialogue of and the first Italian treatise on Wit Matteo Peregrini s Delle acutezze of the term concetto came to add the idea of witty to that of concept and statement In none of these treatises is the word given any prominence in the titles instead we find the subject of literary Wit called acutezza argutezza or arguzia all three terms denoting both the general notion and the particular witticism How relatively unimportant the term concetto seemed to be for Matteo Peregrini is shown by his subtitle delle acutezze che altrimenti spiriti vivezze e concetti volgarmente si appellano it is thus one of a number of popular terms for a witticism or a jest Sforza Pallavicino in I makes the extension from concept to wit and sententiousness explicit in Chapter I o of his Trattato dello stile He says that arguzie which the Romans called sententiae are in Italy named concetti He offers what Aristotle could not an explanation of Wit It works by producing surprise and its beauty depends on its novelty In Tesauro s Cannocchiale aristotelico of we find the term concetti appearing more often and he does give examples of recognizable conceits but concetti do not constitute a class by themselves except in the section on concetti predicabili or preachers conceits These form a class apart and lie outside the scope of this address In I Gracian published the first edition of his now famous work which he then entitled Arte de ingenio tratado de la agudeza in the second enlarged edition of the title is altered to Agudeza y arte de ingenio In contrast to the Italian works Gracian s two versions give prominence to the term concepto for in both the subtitle is In which are explained all the modes of concepts and their differences Here concepto is obviously a key word and the text subjects it to extensive analysis while keeping it within the overriding notion of Wit There is clearly a very important difference between this Spanish use of concept and the Italian use after Gracian as well as before So important and far reaching is this term in Gracian that the style that exemplified his conceptos became known as conceptismo but not till near the end of the eighteenth century The word stuck and has been used ever since Wit in these later Italian theorists is presented as the Great Mother of every ingenious concetto All traditional rhetorical terms are revised and given new nuances within the category ofingegno which is now given special prominence as the name for the mind s inventive faculty Matteo Peregrini considers that traditional aesthetic terms such as grace elegance and polish of style are no longer suitable Tesauro waxes poetically eloquent when he claims that Wit imbues the whole of creation as God s own language But all this is acutezza not concetti Tesauro exalts metaphor as the means of deciphering this language He does not confine it to an extended comparison of two objects for it to be poetically effective it should proceed from a penetrative insight into both objects In ordinary comparisons each object is denoted by its own word and the two remain distinct but in Wit the two are miraculously contracted into one word or phrase Gracian s concepto denotes something so very different from the contemporary Italian term that his use of it came to dominate the histories of literature When Croce wrote on Italian concettismo he borrowed the Spanish word His aim was to study the decadence of Italian literature which he attributed to Spanish influence Something of Gracian s theory which was considered so tortuous and perverse must have been transferred back to the Italian concetto where it did not belong Because it was not differentiated properly from the basic idea of acutezza and argutezza it was natural for English speaking critics and historians of literature to call these concetti conceits instead of concepts or witty concepts Gracian s subject matter is so much more abstruse than that of the Italians his terminology so much more complex and his illustrative examples so much more significant that it was impossible for twentieth century English critics not to assume immediately that his concepto had to mean conceit despite the difficulties this aroused Since his conceptos are said to express correspondences between objects it was natural to translate his types of agudeza into conceits of proportion and disproportion similarity and dissimilarity parity and disparity etc In addition to Mazzeo and Bethell these critics include the Hispanists Edward Sarmiento and T E May who wrote between I and I masterly papers on Gracian s Agudeza which were entirely new and profoundly illuminating These papers seem to have made no impact on Spanish criticism which was not given to intellectual speculation of this kind To these English critics I must now add myself when I published my analysis of Gongora s Polifemo I unhesitatingly applied the term conceits to very many of his metaphors and to the definitions of Gracian s types of agudeza with which I associated them Later I realized that his conceptos had a semantic background to which the term conceit could scarcely be referred This point does not affect my analysis of Polifemo but I must now retract this identifica tion of concepto with conceit as I attempt this incursion into literary history Gracian s Wit and the Art of the Mind is a notoriously difficult work A large part of the difficulty is due to the terminology T E May who is the most acute expositor of Gracian s doctrine suggested on various occasions distinctions between his terms that as far as I can see he never fully clarified or even accepted I find his own exposition in some respects as confusing as he found Gracian himself I believe that this follows from the seeming impossibility at that time of translating concepto as concept May found indeed that concepto agudeza and sutileza could be used indifferently in reference to the conceit The result unless I have seriously misunderstood May is that concepto can appear as anything from a first simple idea in the mind to a highly complicated relationship of many metaphors in one single poetic discourse To this elaborate structure or to most of its parts it is of course impossible to deny the name of conceit May s analysis is often so acute and profound that I hesitate to call it over elaborate Sarmiento s earlier interpretation is simpler to follow but he too lands himself in difficulties through translating concepto as conceit Gracian is indeed subtle and abstruse and I risk being called ingenious if I suggest that his theory can in its essentials be presented in a simpler form The fundamental terms are entendimiento ingenio concepto and agudeza To entendi miento or understanding there corresponds the normal level of discourse working through conceptos agudeza or Wit represents a superior level of thinking which achieves depth and a special sparkle both of which give an aesthetic pleasure of an intellectual kind this Gracian calls the highest function of the human intellect The mental faculty corresponding to this high level of Wit is called ingenio in Gracian s aesthetic it has a special untranslatable sense linked with the ingenium and the Italian ingegno namely the higher form of reason of the Renaissance neo Platonist philos ophers linked with the divine frenzy of the poet Concepto is the idea which the mind conceives and which it develops by extending it to other interrelated ideas When this idea or group of ideas is given expression either in speech or in writing we have a concepto simple or mixed as the case may be This concepto remains on the level of understanding unless the ingenio with its subtle thinking and its creative imagina tion intervenes to give it a formulation that raises it to the level of agudeza May says that Gracian never defines agudeza and this is true but the whole of his art of the mind gives an implicit definition through the innumerable types of Wit which Gracian illustrates Wit consists in the way the ideas are interrelated and in the stylistic artistry of their formulation What makes a thought or a statement witty is the element of astonishment and wonder which had replaced imitation as the main aim of poets this was achieved by a departure from the straightforward and realistic into the recondite and enigmatic If a poet called lips roses that was a simple metaphor but Marino said that the lips of Adonis were for Venus a hedge of roses whence the perfumed breath shoots an arrow and lets fly the viper of love Siepe di rose in cui saetta e scocca Viperetta amorosa arabo fiato L Adone vmII He thus produced an elaboration of the metaphor of lips as pink roses which is so unusual that we have to stop to ponder in order to unravel it roses have scent and this is the breath of Adonis s mouth which stirs Venus to love this scent is then the arrow of Cupid but Cupid is not mentioned instead he becomes the snake in the grass of the Latin proverb latet anguis in herba that is going to bite and poison Venus however roses do not grow in grass but on bushes the lips are therefore a hedge This elaboration of the simple into the complex would have delighted most of Marino s contemporaries although not all his modern readers by the unexpected jumps from metaphor to metaphor This we now call a conceit and this is what Gracian called agudeza He could also have called the complete image a concepto but the idea behind each individual metaphor was also a concepto deriving from the initial or basic concepto that lips may be seductive This illustrates his mixed or complex Wit but Wit can also lie in a simple concept In Gracian s theory a concepto becomes a witty one agudeza not only when there is a clever and surprising extension into another idea but also when various figures other than comparisons are employed as stylistic devices to give a special point to the idea I mean such figures and devices as antithesis parallelism chiasmus parono masia and so on Gracian makes much of two lines from an early ballad by Gongora a man is telling how he fell in love with a girl who lived next door He gives this concepto extra significance by the idea that Fate brought her into the adjoining house so that he might fall in love with her and then expresses this concepto as Junto a mi casa vivia porque yo cerca muriese  She lived next door to my house so that I might die close to her  The Spanish pleases by its admirable neatness Gracian finds many conceptos in these two lines first the mystery behind the fact that the houses are adjacent the act of Fate or Providence secondly it expresses the reason for this is an antithesis which he calls the excellent disproportion of her living in order to kill third there is the exaggeration of suffering as dying fourth this adds a transmutation from the lover s life to his death We might ourselves add a fifth the effective parallelism of her living close and his dying near which joins and contrasts physical proximity with emotional union We find that Gracian s many conceptos thus become five intellectual relationships by means of which the poet s ingenio has effectively and with artistic conciseness elevated the commonplace of falling in love to the plane of agudeza The point I wish to emphasize is that none of these four conceptual relationships is metaphorical none can be called a conceit in present day usage nor can they be called a conceit when taken together The original idea in the mind has become a witty thought when given verbal formulation by the poet s pen and this witty thought is itself composed of five parts which can stand as five different ideas in the mind To translate one or all of these ideas as conceits confuses terminology and analysis Marino s conceit on Adonis is a frivolous one Gongora s long poems are characterized by gravitas I give now an example of his Wit in the form of a conceit In his Soledades when referring to Magellan s circumnavigation of the globe he said of the Pacific archipelagos that their coral reefs because of their beauty and their varied shapes resembled the white marble like limbs of Diana s nymphs bathing in the waters of Eurotas This is far fetched The full image is not simple in its expression but the concepto receives only poetic adornment it is not elaborated intellectually by further metaphors but by a mythological association with the death of Actaeon who was killed when gazing on the forbidden sight of the nymphs beauty In a flash of agreeable surprise the reader recognizes the appropriateness of the metaphor when he remembers that Magellan was killed in the Pacific islands De firmes islas no la inm vil flota en aquel mar del Alba te describo cuyo numero  ya que no lascivo por lo bello agradable y por lo vario la dulce confusi n hacer podia que en los blancos estanques del Eurota la virginal desnuda monteria haciendo escollos o de marmol pario o de terso marfil sus miembros bellos que pudo bien Acte n perderse en ellos I The Wit lies in the association of ideas and in the context which is the commercial cupidity which drives men across the seas into the forbidden territory that geo graphy has made secluded The vision of the forbidden beauty was the basic concept that awaited thematic development This basic idea like the seductiveness of a pair of lips is a concepto their respective elaborations into the hedge of roses and the coral nymphs turn them into witty concepts that is to say agudeza or in English conceits Like all conceits these concepts become witty through comparisons in metaphors or similes I have slid easily into using concept instead of concepto in this analysis because on the plane of understanding this is the natural translation We may now find no difficulty in accepting Gracian s well known definition of a concepto an act of the understanding which expresses the relationship between objects This has been presented by English speaking critics as a definition of conceit and it is fair to say that this has so puzzled non Hispanists who have hoped for enlightenment from Gracian that they have rejected him as confused and unhelpful For is this not really a definition of ordinary metaphor Hispanists beginning with Sarmiento have themselves been puzzled by the fact that Gracian never states that a concepto has an essential relation to trope This difficulty has caused trouble even to May The difficulties I suggest disappear when we realize that a concepto does not have to be a conceit but is basically an idea or thought and that Gracian s relationships do not have to be metaphorical but can be many types of intellectual contrasts similarities or identifications such as the association of physical proximity with emotional union Further we note that in Gracian s definition the concepto is presented only as an act of the understanding if elevated by ingenio into agudeza it then becomes a witty concept which may or may not be a conceit I realize that this distinction is strained but the strain results from the present day sense of conceit It seems sensible to translate Gracian s concepto simply as concept making it clear that this is concept in a special sense Gracian evidently means by concepto not the notion of a class or a single object but a statement or proposition of some kind in particular a thought or an assertion that establishes a conceptual relationship A concept is therefore a thought that provokes further thought which may or may not be witty Tesauro also never implies that every concetto is witty when it is he calls it either a concetto arguto or an arguzia If we turn to dictionaries of the period we find that the admirable Diccionario de Autoridades of does not support Gracian s meaning of concepto An earlier dictionary the Tesoro de la lengua castellana of I II by Covarrubias gives a very different definition The discourse made in the mind and afterwards executed either by the tongue or the pen This signifies reasoned thinking on any matter or a train of thought proceeding by deduction Following the lines of thought that open up before the mind is what Gracian calls ponderation the directions in which the mind is led are called lines of ponderation along which the mind proceeds as it ponders on the object within the categories and adjuncts passing from comparison to comparison From the results of this pondering says Gracian the poet selects those images and conclusions that can be interrelated into a significant unity What he imagines the poet doing is what the poet s reader must do in reverse The more difficult this unravelling the more ingenious the thoughts unravelled the wittier and therefore the more beautiful will the poem be Wit of mysterious ponderation is one of Gracian s many types of agudeza This is a complicated notion of a concept Despite what has generally been thought it is not original except in its application to the critical analysis of poems In itself it is in line with contemporary philosophical terminology into which the scholastic tradition had led One possible reason why English speaking scholars found it easy to think of Gracian s conceptos as conceits lies in the subtitle of his work En que se explican todos los modos y diferencias de Conceptos For modes and differences might well have seemed more appropriate to conceits than to concepts Thus conceit of proportion of disproportion of similitude ofdissimilitude and so on was what he must have meant to say but in naming his various classes he does not say concepto de proporcion but agudeza de proporcion His work is about Wit and Wit that is formulated in speech requires concepts in which to be embodied As already stated contemporary philosophy divided the term conceptus into twenty five types Of these I need mention only three as basic to Gracian s concepto and to Tesauro s concetto conceptus simplex which is the act of immediate apprehen sion of an idea or image called the first operation of the intellect conceptus compositus seu complexus which relates one idea to another called the second operation of the intellect Both Gracian and Tesauro use this latter phrase when referring to the association comparison or contrast of ideas The philosophers grouped the third type conceptus analogiae seu comparationis with conceptus compositus seu complexus The distinction between simple and compound concepts corresponds to Gracian s basic distinction between simple and compound or complex agudeza Gracian s principal terms are therefore philosophical and traditional though his rhetorical analysis describes what we can recognize as a conceit in a modern sense he has no single term to represent it But though his language and his method of distinguishing and classifying are traditional philosophy his conception of ponderation by a series of connected comparisons derives from another source as I shall soon explain First I wish to emphasize that though his terminology is traditional and though his method of analysis is not essentially original his subject matter is The need to analyse and define Wit sprang not from philosophy but from literature The rise and development of seventeenth century Wit as a pervasive literary fashion in Europe were preceded by at least two movements that are common to the main literatures The first is the change from the Ciceronian prose style to the Senecan the second is the influence of Martial and the rise of the epigram Very few traces of Martial s influence in English literature have been found prior to but his influence is marked thereafter In France Germany and Spain the epigram came into its own from the early seventeenth century Martial seems to have been Gracian s second favourite poet after Gongora Agudeza y arte de ingenio was in fact expanded in the second version principally to incorporate many poems from a new and very skilful translation by his friend Manuel de Salinas a Canon of Huesca The vogue of Martial posed a problem for professors of rhetoric The Jesuits were among so many other things the school teachers of Catholic Europe They had devised a curriculum or Ratio Studiorum in which the study of rhetoric through Latin authors played a very important part The problem with Martial who now had to be added to the select list lay in the fact that what differentiated him from the other Latin authors was this now popular but undefined Wit How could this be explained and analysed Some treatises on Wit therefore arose as commentaries on Martial The first was by a Polish professor of rhetoric Casimir Sarbiewski I better known as a neo Latin poet under the name Sarbievius its title was De acuto et arguto It was not printed until from one of two MSS which seem to have been students lecture notes of a course on Martial given by Sarbiewski in  at the Jesuit Academy in Polotsk He might have given this course earlier in Rome Sarbiewski said that when there he searched for a work on Wit and could find none He discussed the subject with rhetoricians in Rome and wrote to fellow Jesuits in Germany and France among them the two dramatists Biedermann and Rader asking for their definitions and explanations He summarized this correspondence in his treatise Acutum for him denotes true Wit argutum he applies to any statement that is clever and ingenious but lacks what he considers the essence of Wit This is defined as a statement that is both impossible and possible at the same time He gives the example from Martial of a hare playing in front of the open jaws of a hungry lion which yet does not devour it Impossible says the reader No answers the poet because the lion belongs to Caesar who is a merciful and magnanimous man Wit causes surprised wonder and this gives pleasure In the Martial epigram the relationship between the lion and Caesar is not metaphorical the lion is not Caesar it merely belongs to him In their letters Biedermann and Rader had written that Wit always required a comparison but Sarbiewski disagreed He nowhere discusses metaphor as such and we should note that he never uses the term conceptus He records that other rhetoricians maintained that Wit inheres in fallacious reasoning This is a point that Tesauro was later to develop more fully than Gracian Both of them greatly expanded Sarbiewski s basic idea of simultaneous concord and discord which remains the precedent for their later theories of Wit Sarbiewski s philosophy and terminology were classical those of Graciain and Tesauro are neo scholastic Gracian like his Polish predecessor was a Jesuit a professor not of rhetoric but of scripture Tesauro was also a member of the same Order for a long period Sarbiewski revealed that the subject of Wit and its definition was widely discussed in Jesuit academic circles it is unlikely that such discussions did not take place in Gracian s own college or come to his notice There is evidence to show that Sarbiewski s ideas became known beyond the Polish academies He himself wished his treatise to be put into writing in order to correct the misrepresentations and distortions that others had given to his teaching Only excerpts were published from his work but his ideas were given wide diffusion by a German Jesuit Michael Radau A number of Latin treatises on acutum et argutum several by Jesuits were published in Germany until as late as I None of these German rhetoricians mentions Gracian although several refer to Tesauro This total neglect of Gracian was probably due to his interests being primarily in the modern literatures of Spain Italy and Portugal and to his disregard of classical rhetoric all of which makes his work non academic It is precisely for this reason that Gracian should have a special appeal for the modern humanities which those German scholars cannot have The close association of the Jesuits with this century long speculation on literary Wit is a remarkable fact The most likely explanation is their special pedagogical interest in rhetoric and their philosophical training with its neo Aristotelian direc tion also the fact that they were an international society whose members travelled freely from country to country and were in touch with other members of the Order who shared their special interests Although Matteo Peregrini was the first to theorize extensively on Wit in a vernacular language Gracian was the first to bring literary theorizing into contact with contemporary literature and life He intersperses anecdotes about living personages refers to relatives and friends and several times recalls and quotes from sermons he has heard This connexion with real life makes his work unique The late German theorists who follow Sarbiewski are pure classicists and want no other authority than that of the ancients Although the Italian theorists do not write in Latin they show a classical bent throughout and are always anxious to square their doctrines with classical authority Tesauro appeals constantly to his master Aristotle Only Gracian is free from classical theory he never mentions Aristotle and though he quotes from Latin authors he expounds these passages on his own authority conscious of embarking on a new exploration This freedom from classical theory gives us the dimension in which we should look for the explanation of the special meaning he gives to the term concept a special meaning which was not developed in Italy until after his treatise He uses the word concepto as if he expected his readers to understand its special sense which he would not have done if he had been breaking new semantic ground With the hindsight that comes from the modern term conceptismo scholars have assumed as they have done with the parallel case of the Italian concetto that all earlier examples of conceptos must be related to Gracian which for English speaking scholars means being related to conceits Lucien Paul Thomas called attention to a possible link which he did not explore between Gracian s treatment of Wit and earlier manuals for preachers citing two such works with conceptus or concepto in their titles Garcia Berrio added another work whose short title was Conceptos extravagantes by Tomas Ramon asserting again without further examination that these works contained well before Gracian the Baroque concepto which he defines as a very violent and catachrestic metaphor Although the title Extravagant Concepts would make anyone searching for conceits thrill with anticipation this work and the others mentioned have nothing to do with conceits They expound the Sunday Gospels in the Roman Missal extracting themes for sermons The conceptos are for the most part no more than ideas for sermons as such they are initial concepts in Gracian s sense offering material for explication The extravagant concepts refer not to the Sunday Gospels but to Masses for special occasions In this literature prior to Gracian s Agudeza y arte de ingenio we find abundant examples of the systematic use of the word concept here it shows all the stages from concept to complex elaborations that can justly be called conceit This intellec tual and religious sphere was of course familiar to Gracian s readers The connexion of preaching with Wit goes back to the Fathers of the Church Sermons form with Martial and Gongora the three principal sources of Gracian s examples Sermons and the literature connected with them are the sources from which Gracian s terminology springs nearly all his characteristic terms in addition to concepto and agudeza derive from there such as ponderacion careo and reparo His method of analysis through pondering on the new ideas arising from the examination of the initial concept in its relation to each of its circumstances and adjuncts thus following the lines of ponderation which the mind discovers in its discourse was the technique of meditation and contemplative prayer Manuals of meditation called the first stage the consideration which was the first review of the subject the second stage was frequently called the ponderation or the amplification of the first stage in new or more complex directions With regard to English metaphysical conceits the technique of meditation has been found in much of the poetry of George Herbert Preaching religious meditation and Gracian s literary agudeza therefore share a common ground in terminology and in the process of conceptualizing Gracian s Agudeza y arte de ingenio requires re examination in the light of this background in particular the relevance of its analytical method to the study of conceptista and metaphysical poetry This must be left for a separate study It has been mistaken to present Gracian as a lonely thinker championing the freedom of the imagination against the tyranny of rules While his originality must always be emphasized he follows a long tradition of religious thinking exemplified in sermons and meditations Moreover he has further links members of the Jesuit Order to which he belonged had already been engaged as professors of rhetoric in the discussion and exposition of the nature of Wit Gracian as a professor himself in a Jesuit college would not have been ignorant of such discussions His originality lies in the sweep with which he encompasses the literature of his age and in the way he utilizes a religious and an academic tradition to construct a literary aesthetic In investigating part of the literary history of the conceit in this address I have ventured to suggest that while the English term is very useful as a descriptive and critical tool it causes much confusion if applied indiscriminately to the concepts of the past Its consistent application to Gracian has made his treatise more obscure than it need have been While the term conceit does indicate that there is more to Gracian s concepto and Tesauro s concetto than ordinary concepts it seems to me better to
