GRACIAN AGUDEZA Y ARTE DE INGENIO IN the year there appeared in Huesca por Juan Nogues al coso the second edition and final form of the longest of Gracian works and the most purely technical Its title Agudeza y arte de ingenio which might be rendered by Keenness and the mind art sufficiently indicates once these strange terms are understood the nature and the object of the work Keenness agudeza is here to be taken as intellectual sharpness agudeza is acuteness in the cutler acceptation or in a more exact but unsympathetic English equivalent martness The mind art is this keenness or smartness and it seems therefore implied that such keenness is the function of the mind Gracian object then is to expound intellectual activity This is borne out by the sub title which reads en que se explican todos los modos y diferencias de conceptos in which are explained all the modes and differences of conceits The mental art of the author is the conceit and he appears to assign to it an exclusive right to be considered the noblest intellectual function Gracian is not lacking in a high estimation of his theme but his attitude is more likely to puzzle and repel the modern reader than attract him For despite the important part that the conceit has played in Italian Spanish and English literature no student of these literatures has shown any great inclination to analyse the nature of the mental device or rhetorical flourish of the conceit This is all the more surprising when we remember that the problem is simplified for the conceit differing as it does totally from all other modes of expression though here no less perhaps are involved the fundamental problems of all thought and expression In his introduction al lector Gracian states that le has formerly devoted some of his works to judgment and but recently the art of prudence but that now he dedicates this book to the intellect the concept in art flaming theory which though some of its subtleties are faintly seen in rhetoric yet do they not reach so far as glimpses for they are like orphan children who their real mother not being known were fostered on to Eloquence Theórica flamante que aunque se traslucen algunas de sus sutilezas en la retorica aun no llegan a vislumbres hijos huerfanos que por no conocer su verdadera madre se prohijaban a la Elocuencia This gives us the first clue to the nature of the conceit and warns us not to assign it to Rhetoric It is generally assumed that the conceit is some kind of figure of speech and it is vaguely understood to be a twisted simile or a false analogy But the conceit is something more than a figure of speech and its analogy if false is yet accepted when the conceit is successfully constructed by the mind that apprehends it It must be more than merely false analogy if it achieves an effect in the mind beyond that of conveying its falseness and anyone who has fallen under the spell of a passage from GÓngora or from one of the English metaphysicals will testify to the peculiarly satisfying quality of the conceit For example Pintadas aves citaras de pluma coronaban la barbara capilla mientras el arroyuelo para oilla hace de blanca espuma tantas orejas cuantas guijas lava de donde es fuente a donde arroyo acaba from Gongora Soledad primera or this from Donne Hymn in Sickness Since I am coming to that holy room Where with thy quire of saints for evermore I shall be made thy music as I come I tune the instrument here at the door And what I must do then think here before The simile is but a simple step in the process of conveying information other than by direct statement in so far as direct statement is ever possible Everyone at some time has curiously awakened to the trite realisation that he cannot speak without rhetoric of some well worn kind and that all his more picturesque efforts in the art of conversation teem with complex figures of speech so too with wit which is almost always a matter of conceits conceits that are hardly serious just as there are conceits that in say religious expression are serious and even solemn Let us take a concrete case If to make use of Donne example I say instead of I am ill I am foretasting death there is here only metaphor but to continue to die is to be made the instrument of God music therefore now I am tuning the instrument there is the essence of the conceit in the continuation of the original simile This case is not a simple one for besides being a continuation of the simile ickness is as a foretaste of death there has been a tacit substitution of death by being made God music There is really a continuation of two similes in series A simpler case is that of the Spanish example The preliminary simile is The foam that the stream makes on coming against a pebble is like an ear The simple continuation is The stream makes of foam as many ears as it washes pebbles to listen to the bird song Here an apparent reason is given justifying the preliminary and possibly fantastic simile Remembering Butler much quoted couplet from Hudibras let us construct a home made conceit If I say The sun set in a sky as red as lobster we have merely a simile as incongruous as the original If however I say The sun set in a sky as red as lobster but though the lobster turns from black to red the sunset sky turns from red to black and I might continue a symbol of the relative qualities of mere sunset and delightful lobster I produce the conceit and its justification Since this example is not the work of poetic genius it has the disadvantage of not being particularly striking or significant but for this very reason not obscuring the mind with an emotional reaction it may serve to expose the essential nature of the conceit continuation of the logical process started or even only implied by ordinary trope In this case the con tinuation is made by exhibiting lack of similarity or even contradiction when at first we had suggested similarity what Gracian terms agudeza por contradiccion y repugnancia en los afectos y sentimientos del animo although here it is contradiction in the terminos rather than in the animo In his introduction Gracian says Valese la Agudeza de los tropos como de instrumentos para exprimir cultamente sus conceptos pero contienense ellos a la raya de fundamentos materiales de la sutileza cuando mas de adornos del pensamiento That is the figure of speech is limited to providing the ground for the conceit the conceit itself is a more complex operation than the figure of speech What it is it is Gracian intention to show us in the first part of the book The book is divided into sixty three Discursos each purporting to deal with one kind of conceit it is obvious from the number that this cannot be so and we find that only the first sixteen discourses treat of the four fundamental modes of conceit modos de agudeza and that the majority of the remaining forty seven discourses are variations in the application of these modes as will presently be shown These forty seven discourses do not imply so many possible manners of application several times two or more discourses are devoted to the same or to a nearly related type At the fiftieth discourse the first part of the Agudeza ends The second part is devoted to compound conceits by which is meant long sustained works composed of conceits combined together This is a not very successful attempt to include all kinds of literary art under the conceptist method Gracian yields to a temptation few theorists can resist that of supposing that their single theory will cover all phenomena In this second part also there is a discourse devoted to the consideration of style and another to the sources of the conceit In the first discourse Gracian states that as the ancients discovered the rules of thought in logic and of expression in rhetoric so he will discover the art and rules of the conceit Hallaron los antiguos metodo al silogismo arte al tropo sellaron la agudeza o por no ofenderla o por desahuciarla remitiendola a sola la valentia del ingenio and Pero no se puede negar arte donde reina tanta la dificultad Armase con reglas un silogismo frjese pues con ellas un concepto Discourse I Gracian continues that authors in the past have usually had their conceptism criticised on the ground of sameness and lack of freshness he proposes the kinds of conceit so that these may be more freely used and produce greater variety Censuranse en los mas ingeniosos escritores las agudezas antes por unas que por unicas y homogeneos sus conceptos y es que falta el arte por mas que exceda el ingenio He starts off by defining the psychological assumptions lying behind his theories and quotes the scholastic doctrine or rather in the language of the schools refers to the obvious fact that Tiene cada potencia un rey entre sus actos y un otro entre sus objetos entre los de la mente reina el Concepto triunfa la Agudeza We therefore see at once that for Gracian conceits are the very highest act of the mind The second discourse continues this idea restating it in an interesting way he says lo que para los ojos es la hermosura y para los oidos la consonancia eso es para el Entendimiento el concepto whence we may infer that the conceit this function of the mind is a kind of artistic beauty He does indeed repeat farther on in the same discourse no se contenta el ingenio con sola la verdad sino que aspira a la hermosura where necessarily a beauty other than the kind which satisfies sight is meant The art of the conceit is for Gracian really a part if not the whole of literary art beyond and distinct from rhetoric which merely deals with the construction and use of figures In halting terms and entirely relying on the excessive divisioning and redivisioning of orthodox philosophy he affirms that as all things are in sympathy with the different powers of the soul that produce or observe them so the conceit must be equal to the mind that perceives or creates it and that as the cause of this sympathy is proportion in the things themselves and is what pleases the power that corresponds to it so the cause of the conceit ability to please the mind or intellect must also be harmony and pro portion and he continues Resaltan mas con unos que con otros los extremos cognoscibles si se unen y el correlato que es realce de sutileza para uno es lastre para otro A first hint this of the question of taste To understand the next step in the discovery of the nature of the conceit it is better to read first what he says in the fourth discourse about the essential and fundamental kind of conceit de correspondencia y proporcin The passage runs Es el sujeto sobre quien se discurre y pondera ya en conceptuosa panegiri ya en ingeniosa crisi digo alabando o vituperando uno como centro de quien reparte el discurso lineas de ponderacin y sutilez a las entidades que lo rodean esto es a los adjuntos que lo coronan como son sus causas sus efectos atributos calidades contingencias circunstancias de tiempo lugar modo etc y cualquiera otro termino correspondiente Valos careando de uno en uno con el sujeto y unos con otros entre si y en descubriendo alguna conformidad o conveniencia que digan ya con el principal sujeto ya unos con otros exprimela ponderala y en estos esta la sutileza In the same discourse he adds later Hallase simetria intelectual entre los terminos del pensamiento tanto m&s pri morosa que la material entre columnas y acroteras cuanto va del objeto del ingenio al de un sentido This conception of things as consisting in relationships which make fit objects of comparison is at the root of the idea of the conceit and at the bottom of all discourse It differs from the notion implied by mere figures by the presence of the idea that it is relationship among the things that makes the conceit possible for it is this that constitutes the basis of that continuation of the mere figure that is the conceit whether that continuation be an argument of justification or merely discursive The foundation of the figure on the other hand lies only in the fact of similarity among things The peculiar power of the conceit resides in the fact that it is a relationship among things that is only apparent or verbally in the names of them but which nevertheless is justified from an imaginary or other non material unworldly point of view Gracian defines the conceit then in Discourse II with this idea in his mind and says Es un acto del entendimiento que exprime la corre spondencia que se halla entre los objetos A point however which Gracian does not insist on and which as we have just indicated would seem to be true is that the conceit although reposing on this foundation has not yet really begun at this stage We generally assume the conceit to be in a general kind of way a false analogy of some kind yet effective even if false because susceptible of justification or discourse in a con tinuation or prolongation of the first analogy Gracian himself realised this for in a later discourse devoted to semejanza similarity he is more than doubtful whether mere similarity contains agudeza and whether it is not necessary for the production of conceit to extend the similarity on a second ground not at first perceived or at least not mentioned In his anxiety to include all processes of thought and all types of expression in his conceptist scheme he tended to press the invasion of the conceit into regions where it does not properly belong and conversely to admit conceit when it is not in fact present as in this case of semejanza The final point to observe in this second discourse is the insistence on Esta correspondencia es generica a todos los conceptos y abraza todo el artificio del ingenio que aunque este sea tal vez por contraposicin y disonancia aquello mismo es artificiosa conexin de los objetos He has here repeated the essential quality of the conceit for trope is satisfied with epithet or simple statement at most abbreviated or telescoped as in metaphor synecdoche metonymy and the rest as being an act of mental comparison in which objects are placed in juxtaposition and shown in their different aspects to be similar or dissimilar and although it does not appear from this quotation it becomes abundantly clear as we are given example after example and in such phrases as judgment juicio is satisfied with truth whereas understanding ingenio with beauty beauty here is agudeza that this similarity or dissimilarity is not necessarily real or true but fanciful and that the comparison is not of the scientific kind which states factual resemblance but of the mental dream kind stating truths of the fancy For the moment let us bear in mind that an important indeed an essential part of the conceit is indicated in the words objects in juxtaposition Having thus defined the essence of the conceit Gracian next considers the classification of the conceit into its various modes and finally re solves them into four although it is a defect of his terminologS that he continues to use the word modo even when he is considering what are really only applications or utilisations of modos as when e g in Discourse XLIII he considers apodos as a pure mode when it is but a method of applying any one of the fundamental modes that he has considered in Discourses iv to xv With very rare exceptions all the discourses after the fifteenth are similarly methods of applying the conceit Before examining these four modes it is interesting and instructive to see what other classification Gracian considers and rejects First he postulates again following scholastic tradition that difference could be of essence or of accident both being sufficient to adorn agudezca The first distinction is between keenness agudeza of perspicacity and that of artifice artificio or as we should say the distinction between the faculty for discovering the quality of the conceit in external reality or alternatively material therein for the conceit and the faculty for inventing conceits The latter faculty is the subject of our study esta es el asunto de nuestra Arte Another way of classifying on which Gracian touches is to distinguish between the conceits of thought and those of word a third division is that of action distinguished from that of word But says Gracian this distinction is one of accident rather than of essence and continues Mas propiamente se dividiera en Agudeza de correspondencia y conformidad entre los extremos objetivos del concepto que son los correlatos que une para la artificiosa sutileza La otra es Agudeza de contrariedad o discordancia entre los mismos extremos del concepto Pero esta divisin de la Agudeza no abarca todas sus especies como las Crisis exageraciones y otras A fifth way is to consider agudeza pura and agudeza mixta that is combinations of more than one mode Still another method of classifi cation is to distinguish between simple incompleja and compound compuesta this is the division above referred to which determines the separation of the book as a whole into two parts in the second of which an attempt is made to include under the head of Agudeza com puesta all the major types of lengthier composition Gracian therefore accepts this division and then proceeds Vuelvese a dividir la Agudeza incomplexa en sus generos y modos y se reducen a cuatro como raices fuentes del conceptear These four are i de correlacin ii de ponderacion iii de raciocinacin iv de invencin These are now considered in turn in the next dozen discourses But it is not clearly stated how this sixth fourfold division differs from the fourth quoted above which had reduced the conceit to two kinds that of likeness and that of unlikeness nor is it to be explained in what way this last classification contains anything to distinguish the two How ever we have seen how the essence of the conceit lies in the approxima tion of two elements for purposes of a prolonged comparison either by demonstrating likeness or its contrary it is not really important if Gracian failed to maintain any very rigid classification of the ways of carrying out this comparison Taking the four in order we have correspondence proportion the essence of this seems to be to discover proportion between the extremes or terms of the percepts made use of it is in this discourse that the passage already quoted occurs Hallase simetria etc which makes of all objects a collection of relationships with the rest of reality This discourse proceeds noting such points as that the more violent the juxtaposition of the terms or extremes elements the more striking and effective the conceit that the juxtaposition may be between any attributesl finally stating that this correlation will be all the more ingenious conceptist therefore if rather than being discovered actually to exist it is invented in the imagination or the fancy Examples of this manufactured correspondence are given from Martial the preacher Andrada Quevedo and others Discourse II Another discourse the fifth is given up to the other aspect of this type of conceit that of improportion which consists in finding an inverse relationship a proportionate dissimilarity between the terms examples are given from every kind of source Frmanse por artificio contrapuesto a la proporcin the type we have just dealt with alli se busca la correspondencia aqui al contrario la oposición entre los extremosl This discourse ends with the following words confirming what has already been said about the absence of any real further classification at least as Gracian himself would have said as to essence Estas son las agradables proporciones y improporciones del discurso concordancia y disonancia del concepto fundamento y raiz de todo el artificio conceptuoso porque o comienza o acaba en esta harmonia de los objetos correlatos como se vera en todas las demas especies por eso se le proponen en primer lugar al Ingenio The next three discourses vi vii and viIn consider la agudeza por ponderacion Consiste el artificio en levantar misterio entre la conexin de los extremos o terminos del sujeto y despues de ponderada aquella coincidencia y unin dase una razn sutil y adecuada que la satisfaga de suerte que dos partes incluye esta Agudeza la una es la ponderacion y la otra es la razn que se da y sta es la principal formalidad de esta Agudeza There is a special consideration of those ponderations in which it is difficult to establish in the second part of the conceit the satisfactory relationship which is to provide the answer to the ponderation expression of surprise or wonder at a thing of the first part Aniade esta especie de Agudeza al artificio de la ponderacin misteriosa la dificultad entre la conexion de los extremos digo los terminos correlatos y despues de bien exprimida la dificultad o discordancia entre ellos dase una razn que la desempefia Discourse viii deals with the acme of this type Ponderaciones de contrariedad in which is pondered not merely a mysterious relation ship nor even one difficult to justify but actually one that is or appears to be contradictory Unir a fuerza de discurso dos contradictorios ex tremos extremo arguye de la sutileza The next five discourses are concerned with agudeza por semejanza and its varieties This is the third class of conceits in the fourfold classifi cation given in Discourse III there called de raciocinacion It is difficult to see how that term can be applied here There is no doubt in any case that by semejanza Gracian means the simile as understood in rhetoric This is a mode of comparison resulting in an equation between two elements perhaps this could have been considered also as a type of correspondence in attributes but it was in any case convenient to make a special consideration of it and its ramifications apart Gracian defines this type of conceit thus En este modo de conceptear carbase el sujeto no ya con sus adjacentes propios sino con un termino extrafio como imagen que le exprime su ser o le representa sus propiedades efectos causas contingencias y demas adjuntos no todos sino algunos o los mas principales He then adds the following afterthought No tienen algunos por Agudeza la semejanza pura sino una de las flores retoricas pero no se puede negar sino que es conceptuosa y sutileza de la inventiva This last is mere assertion on the part of Gracian and it seems difficult to prove that an ordinary simile is a conceit unless recourse is had to some exceptional case which is what Gracian does En la misma semejanza pura se hallan sus primores de Ingenio que la realzan grandemente con una sola se pueden exprimir dos contrarios efectos asi D Luis de GÓngora Que los dos nos parecemos al roble que mas resiste los soplos del viento airado tu en ser dura yo en ser firme Now it is possible to consider this example from two points of view and the case is an interesting example of how thin the partition may become between mere figure and full conceit First we may think of this simile as a conceit owing to the fact that the first comparison pro posed is difficult of justification since the poet suggests that two persons of opposite sentiments are each like the same object an oak On the other hand one may say that there is no conceit here and that the poet is making an unreal distinction or rather an unconvincing distinction between the hardness and the firmness of the oak and even that there is not so great a difference in quality between the hardness of the lady and the persistence of the lover In any case the matter is decided Nocte pluit tota redeunt spectacula mane divisum Imperium cum Iove Caesar habet Virgil As an example of the contradictory ponderation Thays habet nigros niveos Lecania dentes Quae ratio est emptos habet haec illa suos Martial empirically for the quotation is not by any means an example of the satisfying conceit Le falta alma de sutileza However that may be Gracian rather retracts his statement later in the tenth discourse that mere simile may be a conceit He says then No cualquier semejanza en opinin de muchos contiene en si sutileza ni pasa por concepto sino aquellas que incluyen alguna otra formalidad de misterio contrariedad correspondencia improporcin sentencia etc Estas dicen son objetos de esta Arte incluyen a mas del artificio retorico el conceptuoso sin el cual no serian mas que tropos o figuras sin alma de sutileza Whether this is Gracian own statement or whether he is really quoting another writer on the subject or repeating discussions on the matter with the poets and writers that he frequented Gracian accepts this amplifying statement and thereby apparently nullifies the attitude of Discourse ix in so far as he there inclines to admit any simile as a conceit The rest of Discourse x is occupied with the discussion of other modes with which la semejanza pura may be combined to elevate it to the dignity of a conceit in other words with the combinations that will afford ground for the continuation of the figure that is essential for the construction of the conceit For here again that principle is capable of application The distinction between the rhetorical simile and the conceptist simile obeys Gracian ruling already quoted Valese la Agudeza de los tropos y figuras retoricas como de instrumentos para exprimir cultamente sus conceptos pero contienense ellos a la raya de fundamentos materiales de la sutileza that is to say that figures are the ground the matter for the formation of the conceit that to constitute it there must be a second justifying reason for the simile which is brought out understanding of course that the reason may be poetical or fanciful only or else that the simile is established between terms that at first sight offer no ground real or easily imagined for such an approximation We have just seen from the example of Gongora verse that a simile may sometimes be considered from either point of view Another example less complex and indecisive may be of help To say my love is like fire is hardly a conceit but rather an obvious simile it will not even develop into a conceit if I give the reason for my com parison such as saying my love is fierce like fire or purifying like fire because all these elaborations are merely information not an additional simile To add however that Like fire also my love consumes itself to dust and ashes will bring the simile into the realm of the conceit be cause there I have found an additional reason for the original comparison and have utilised the first simile to establish the second hitherto hidden one for I doubt whether it would have been a conceit to say from first my love dwindles to dust and ashes yet it might once more cross the border to the conceptuoso if I said my love has dwindled to dust and ashes that once was a bright flame for here although we have the second part placed first it still derives an additional force by being shown to rest on the presupposed preliminary comparison with a flame The truth would seem to be that because we are able to find an additional reason for comparison with the same thing love with flame or fire when bright and with flame or fire when burnt out we are able thereby to construct the conceit i e the simile is able to be prolonged The question here enters as regards our example just given as to effectiveness of presentation clearly the first presentation was infinitely more striking than the second where the furtherance of the simile was given away at the beginning of the sentence and really not seen to be more than a simile a prolongation until we had heard the second half except of course that whereas fire does not necessarily suggest ashes ashes imply pre vious fire This question of presentation is frequently touched on by Gracian especially in the later discoursesl Three more discourses are devoted to various types of conceptuous simile Discourses xiv xv and xvI deal with the fourth fundamental type of conceit as given in Discourse iv that formed por paridad Here again there is a change in the nomenclature for in Discourse II the fourth and last type of conceit was called de invencin Este es el cuarto orden de conceptos says Discourse xiv however making it quite clear that the reference is to Discourse III que se funda tambien en el careo del sujeto con algdn termino no ya por semejanza sino por disparidad De esta paralela combinacion salen las comparaciones o dis paridades conceptuosas que pueden ladearse con la mas agradable sutileza And later pero es de notar que no cualquiera comparacion encierra Agudeza sino aquellas a quienes da pie y fundamento para el careo alguna circunstancia especial en que se funde la conformidad de los terminos para levantar la comparacion conceptuosa que sin esta no sera sutileza sino una desnuda figura retorica sin viveza de ingenio como se dijo de la semejanza y otras Here Gracian experience of the difficulty in disentangling trope from conceit has borne fruit in this clear and definite preliminary statement As in the case of semejanza an example taken from the Agudeza may serve to show what conceptos por paridad in the discourse is quite clear It is a sonnet of Miguel de Ribellas caballero valenciano to St Michael Archangel The two tercets are Postrareme a tus St Michael pies con tu licencia y alli do Lucifer esta tendido juntos los dos haremos penitencia que si al mismo Senior tengo ofendido no queda entre l y mi mas diferencia de estar el pertinaz yo arrepentido From this example and others in the text it is evident what the quality of this type of conceit is the bringing together of two subjects not easily otherwise associable in this case the poet and Satan It is in fact the same basis as the type of conundrum Why is an X like a Y rests on Possibly in this preliminary work of establishing through some similar action or other attribute the similarity of X and Y lies the reason for calling the conceit de paridad de invencin remembering the root meaning of the word finding It should be observed that this type also could have been considered as finding a correlation or in the case of a disparidad its converse an inverse relationship But again Gracian has found it more workable to look on this type as a fourth and the last of the fundamental types of conceit The modes of conceit dealt with in the remaining discourses differ considerably in simplicity of construction from these four here considered in the Discourses iv to xv These remaining discourses xvI to LXIII are dealt with elsewhere as was stated above generally the subsequent discourses consider what might better have been called by some such name as an application of one of these four fundamental modes modes which we have already hinted are in reality not four but two only THERE is much value for us in the Arte de ingenio apart from its utility as an indication of the nature of conceptist art even as a guide to the conceit in all epochs certainly as an enquiry into this kind of expression incidentally therefore into the very soul of wit which is not brevity but speed but these considerations are not likely to weigh with a reading public whom Gracian himself would have contemptuously ignored as vulgo What still is of value to all interested in questions of aesthetic and the history of aesthetic theory is the general ideas explicit and implied contained in this enormous volume There remains one more source of interest and value in the Agudeza for the modern reader In it we have a highly trained workman in a tradition of no simple art standing at the end of one of the most brilliant or at least for the sake of the unsympathetic let us call it glittering periods in any national literature Gracian stands on the very verge of the nothingness that swallowed up all Spain in the second half of the seventeenth century and he looks back over a period of achievement that starts up suddenly from the Middle Ages a span of close on one hundred and fifty years The examples quoted in the Agudeza number well over one thousand of which quite five hundred are from Spanish writers of the golden age The remainder are drawn from the classics especially the bilbilitano Martial and from the Fathers of the Church every reader of the Roman Breviary knows it for an inexhaustible mine of conceits these five hundred modern Spanish quotations form an anthology of baroque literature that can be equalled only by the Cancioneros of an earlier age in quality and representative ness The author most quoted is as one would expect Góngora quotations from whom come near to one hundred many of them lengthy Besides him are quoted freely the brothers Argensola Rufo el Jurado de Crdoba Lope de Vega each of these writers is represented to the number of thirty to forty quotations Mendoza Mateo Aleman Luis de Len the preacher Andrade many sacred orators are introduced to us in these pages amongst them the famous Paravicino Castiglione author of II Cortegiano and Herrera are amply quoted also significantly Boccalini John Barclay Marino Guarini Alciatus among the Italian and other foreign writers amongst whom figure also the Portuguese Montemayor and naturally Camoes of both of whom no doubt Gracian heard much from Pablo de Prada His own family are given honourable mention and the quotations Gracian gives us from their sayings sermons or writings afford us attractive glimpses of his and their private life One of the quaintest and most appealing of Gracian tastes is for Don Juan Manuel Conde Lucatnor The importance of most of these authors from another point of view that of considering sources for Gracian other works more especially the Criticn cannot be overestimated and the tallying of his opinions as expressed here and in the Criticon affords an instructive example of the stability of his literary criticism There was no modern edition of the book till when Sr Ovejero reprinted it from the second Huesca edition in the series of Filsofos espanoles Unfortunately this hardly succeeds in being a reprint since there are so many slips and omissions The full version and the work usually referred to here as the Agudeza is the second edition of Gracian book Six years before this Gracian had published a first edition of this work con privilegio en Madrid por Juan Sanchez a costa de Roberto Lorenco mercader de libros This was published with the same main title shorter than in succeeding editions as that of the second edition Arte de ingenio tratado de la Agudeza en que se explican todos los modos y diferencias de conceptos under the name of Lorengo Gracian There are two copies known of this first edition one is the copy in the Bibliotheque Nationale of Paris the other is in the Biblioteca Nacional of Madrid It differs only slightly from the second edition except for the great increase of examples in the latter The bulk of the second edition is also increased because of the translations some eighty in number and mostly long of Martial made by the canon of Huesca Cathedral Manuel Salinas These had been prepared for the press as Gracian explains by Salinas but seem never to have reached the dignity of publication on their own for they were incorporated in the second edition of the Agudeza and of course as part of the text reprinted with every new edition of it Most of the old examples are retained in the second edition but frequently are altered in position and even occasionally illustrate quite another species of conceit one more indication that beyond the consideration n of the fundamental nature of the conceit Gracian had not evolved a very rigid scheme of classification There are interesting trifling changes of word or phrase which show the thought Gracian bestowed on his style In the terminology too there are frequent alterations but they do not seem to move in the direction of greater consistence although usually the sense is made clearer in the individual instance or at least amplified by the addition of a synonymous term not the best procedure for securing a definite terminology Especially noticeable is the way in which in the second edition Gracian secures greater concision and verbal compactness in a sentence but sometimes at the loss of good terre a terre assurance in the meaning As to doctrine there is no development whatever between the two editions save that all the various types of conceit are worked out with far greater detail The main division into two and then another two types which is contained in the first sixteen discourses of the second edition of had existed from the beginning In the former edition this matter had been contained in the first fifteen discourses only There are however two curious corroborations of the view put forward in this study that subsequent divisions are not really types of conceit One is that under the discourses concerned with semejanza is included one on Apodos which in the second edition are given separate treatment The other which might be only a slip is that in Discourse xiv xiv in both editions the fourteenth discourse of becomes in the later edition xiv and xv for Este es el cuarto orden de conceptos which are the words of the second edition the first edition reads Este es el seguzdo orden although primero segundo and tercero have been correctly given Possibly the author himself was conscious that the third and fourth types were but repetitions in a special way of the first and second Discourses XVI XLI in the earlier edition become XVII L in the later but this does not indicate any new matter in the second edition as these eight new discourses are in every case extensions of older types that in the first edition were dealt with in only one discourse and were extended into two or more in the second edition An example is the case of the early Discurso xvII De los encarecimientos conceptuosos which becomes the four Discourses xIx xx xxI and xxII of the second edition The order of treatment in the two editions however is entirely different but one way seems as good as the other Part I ends in the case of the first edition with Discourse XLI and the second part became in the longer by four discourses otherwise remaining identical except of course in length and number of examples The four extra discourses represent two entirely new topics that of the use of erudition and the discourse entitled Ideas del hablar bien which is a further discussion of style No doubt the enormous quantities of examples sug gested to Gracian a consideration of the literary virtues which he must have prided himself on possessing Turning now to a consideration of Gracian Eesthetic as a whole we must in the first place rid ourselves of any hostility to the idea of metaphysical art and to the conceit Despite the work of Professor Grierson and despite the modern tendency in poetry to return to some thing of the conception of the metaphysicals despite too the recent revival of interest in Donne and to some extent in writers like Crashaw due perhaps to the sudden apparition and meteoric career of Francis Thompson there is still a prejudice against the strange art of the conceptists In Spain and amongst hispanisants we see too the impatience with which anything connected with the conceptistic aspect of Gracian is received especially marked in Croce and Coster where it is but the more to be deplored In the striking revival of interest in the moral teaching of Gracian of which M Andre Rouveyre is the brilliant spokesman there is no mention at all of the conceptist Gracian M Victor Bouiller however in practice treats the text of Gracian with a scrupulous care and renders his difficult style into French a language peculiarly recalcitrant to anything that approaches verbal or mental play with a success that can only be the fruit of a genuine appreciation of this aspect of Gracian But the conceit and the whole attitude implied by the conceit is a thing that has to be understood and approached sympathetically if the Spanish mind and language are to be known at all For the conceit and the conceptist art and if one may call it so the conceptist mentality are an essential aspect of Spain of the Spains of course It must not be thought from this that there is any streak of irresponsible mental gymnastic in Spanish thought It is precisely the value of this conceptist attitude that it is earnest or perhaps better sincere and grave as indeed Gracian himself is sincere and grave It is this fact that robs carping criticism of the Comulgatorio of all its sting How much of the effect of so human and unliterary a writer as Miguel de Unamuno depends on nothing other than the conceit The famous passage Paloma in El Cristo de Velazquez depends wholly on the conceit of considering Christ under the form of a dove that went forth from Noah Ark or if it be objected that this example is but in the usual course of religious symbolism it ought rather to be noted that the conceit is in truth essential to all religious symbolism let us take the more complicated passage from the same poem Part III section xxvII oporte Naturaleza El leno de tu cruz esta podado de su fronda bajo no se columbra tierra cuyo verdor ha ido a fundirse con la blancura de tu cuerpo The whole passage is equally rich in conceits Not to confine ourselves to the educated and cultured let us take any of the Peninsular or American collections of romances or coplas and see whether the people too do not delight in the expression of their deepest feeling through the medium of the conceit I lost the ring you gave me when I went to the water one day the vow that you made was of water and the water bore it away says one translated by Havelock Ellis in his Sonnets and Folksongs and another given by Professor de Madariaga in his essay on the Spanish folk song Como dos arboles somos que la suerte nos separa con un camino por en medio pero se juntan las ramas or this one En el pozo mas hondo de mi corazn sembre una pasionera cogi una pasin or again these from Don Jose Antonio Restrepo Cancionero de Antio quia the Colombian Antioquia of course Salga el sol salga la luna salgan todas las estrellas salga la vidita mia en medio de todas ellas Una estrella se ha perdido Y en el cielo no parece En tu pecho se ha metido Y en tu cara resplandece It is then characteristic of the Spaniard to express even profound emotion by the twisted metaphor or exaggerated comparison that makes a conceit As Gracin says for the uncultured the ability to conceptear is entirely el esfuerzo de la mente but the conscious artist should be able to produce this vivid concept at will The conceptist attitude is but an example of that definition of a philosopher as the man who sees con nexions The use of the conceit implies the requisites for what we call culture in the case of the spontaneous popular manifestation an incipient nt naif culture in the case of the deliberate artistry it supposes the foundations of real culture Constantly the reader of the Agudeza is reminded that for Gracian all art consists of relationships real or imagined perceived or invented For Gracian as we saw from our quotations above there exist objects in the external world which are indifferent there exist perceptions of these in the mind which may be made beautiful by the devices of rhetoric lastly there exist relationships between these percepts whether or not adorned by figures of speech in addition and the expression of these relationships is the concept the conceit All relationship is apprehended as the result of the mental comparison of things the essence of conceptistic art is to bring together objects more accurately percepts or better still from the artistic standpoint images in juxtaposition for the purpose of making this comparison A great deal of the efficiency of a good conceit lies in the mere fact of the juxtaposition To bring together unexpected elements to form a plastic whole fresh surprising new elements too in most cases of strong emotional appeal in themselves such as words well fitted to their sense or images of universal significance like heart fire star blood and the rest is plainly a powerful aid in the formation of the conceit Gracian rarely touches on this point He says clearly that he has no intention of dealing with matters of style into which this aspect of the conceit would lead us and he excludes likewise questions of no less interest which we may wonder whether he would have appreciated as for example that sense of remoteness clear out lined distances that we have come to associate with baroque art and which Gracian himself was expert in achieving This art is even now contemptuously received by most people lectures and writings on for example baroque architecture rarely get away from the defects usually conceded to it defects which exist only in judging it as something that it is not classical architecture By all means let classical art be preferred and given pride of place But it is a fact that in every sphere the classical is short lived The decadent the fatigued if that is really the correct word to apply the complicated the over intellectual the baroque supervenes This type of art is bound to come we might have at least the grace to acknowledge that it can be well done Gracian himself did it supremely well and in addition thought about it and Gracian with his Agudeza stands at the end of a long line or rather stands the last to vanish of a great pleiad of conceptist artists Gongora the chief among them and they have proved that intellectual art can be not less than angelical as Baltasar Gracian himself wrote He was throughout particularly insistent on the intellectual quality of conceptist art as the eye is filled with seeing and the ear with hearing he said Jesuitically misquoting scripture o is the mind with the concept For Gracian Understanding the chief of the powers of the soul was only exercising its exalted function when it was perceiving those relationships that build the conceit or else turning from the external world and from truth which in the scholastic definition is correct statement about it inventing relationships and their like building them in the world of fancy But this is the work of artificio and we are on the verge of the question for Gracian always so pressing of the will From this insistence on the mental side of conceptism we see that for Gracian in the same way that the perception of truth and the invention of relationship in the mind were the two highest occupations of the soul so it was the special function of art to create these relationships of the fancy art for Gracian is a thing of willed construction in the mind Taste too has its place here for some of these percepts relate better than others for the forming of the concept The artist who is trying to construct an effective conceit has to exercise judgment in the producing of primorosa concordancia harmoniosa correlacion It is further of interest to Gracian theory of art that there are two types of beauty the beauty that the eye enjoys and that which the intellect demands The first is not his concern the second is all relationships art is the method of creating and expressing them In his art as in all art things that are not lovely in themselves for eye or ear become beautiful for intellect when conceived in the mind as in the Criticn he quotes Aristotle to this effect These conceptions within the mind or imagination are woven into fantastic relationships by the power of the conceit and so enter that supreme beauty which imposes order on matter and by the force of their swift appeal and conviction bring a satisfaction which other types of art lack It is important not to be repelled by Gracian overdependence on the excessive divisioning and subdivisioning that he resorts to in the Agudeza it is too easy to say the light that never was on land or sea becomes in conceptist poetry too much of an artificial light for Gracian would have jumped at the word the light of artifice is precisely the illumination he craved for and for him it is the light of eternity It is sometimes said and Gracian certainly attempted to prove it that all literary art of a matter of conceits The epic narrative of great length the drama the romance and all the rest are but conceits on a larger scale and in a slower movement But in that largeness and especially in that slower movement lies the essential difference Either the conceit apart from its essential requirement of prolongation is precisely a short rapid and effective assimilation of the diverse elements that compose it or we can no longer talk accurately about these things In so far as the epic and the romance draw together diverse elements in their narrative and from them recreate a new vision of the proportion of the universe true or not matters not for art they conform to the function of con ceptist art but not to its method they are not conceits Gracian either in ignorance or more likely to extend the jurisdiction of his rules and theories does not realise this At times even within the realm of the brief passage he seems to admit as conceits tropes that are merely daring strange or far fetched without constituting a real conceit as genuine examples of his art In these two directions he tries to extend the application of his definition to include lengthy works and to include what is merely surprising without reaching the complexity of the conceit The conceit is in two movements one the establishing of a point of contact between disparate objects the second furthering their connexion so justifying their preliminary juxtaposition Such an art must necessarily be an art of brevity rapidly accomplished or the thread of its tenuous discourse will be broken And so its fundamental principles may very well as we might expect provide a foundation for all the arts but its materials which are mental images and its manner which is prompt must be all its own In so far as Gracian admitted examples in his Agudeza which did not conform to these his own definitions he was inconsistent In so far too as Gracian omitted to add to his definitions these further unmistakable marks of the conceit brevity and rapidity his treatise was perhaps incomplete But he saw clearly none clearer what were the principles of an art of which the conceit is one manifestation and the whole is all that period of strange attraction we term baroque If Gracian missed the necessary insistence on brevity for now and again as for example in the discourse on the Apodo he hints at rapidity we cannot doubt that he was aware if only vaguely of its importance for his chosen craft Lo bueno si breve dos veces bueno is true more than of anything of the conceit And too Gracian very lukewarmness in advancing the theory of Agudeza compuesta suggests that here he was uncertain of himself It is too often said Croce in his pamphlet on Gracian more than implies it that the conceit is but a form of the principle of all art the metaphor The metaphor of course is not the principle of all art any more than the conceit is it is the principle like the conceit of an art The essence of the metaphor is emotional appeal the touching of one element in the com parison with the emotional qualities of the other Moreover it is single it has but one stage when the comparison is stated and the emotional transference achieved its work is done The conceit goes further it has a different object It aims at exhibiting a more recondite relationship than that which apparently prompts the first juxtaposition and in order to effect this it must make another a second statement about the two terms of the comparison in which the further and hidden relationship is revealed and expressed In general one may say that classical art is of metaphor the artist of the baroque is not an artist of simple metaphor he is an artist of hard discovered relationship No doubt and this perhaps accounts for the impatience so often shown when dealing with it the conceit is foredoomed to failure as poetical achievement at least in so far as it relies on itself for the plain reason that the ordinary poetic mind does not work on a purely rational basis such as is postulated by the manufactured conceit and it is the ordinary poetic mind that will prevail The conceit by the modern artistic consciousness can probably only be acceptable in the exercise of wit or epigram If the conceit appears to convince artistically and attain the rank of highest art it may be found that what has achieved this is some extraneous quality in the conceit that is not of its essence the strangeness in the juxtaposition set up or some poetic quality in the terms themselves Gracian did not suggest any of these things as being possible for to him the essence of literary art lay in expressing any relationship and the conceit which is devoted exclusively to this work naturally appeared the supreme example of artistic form This is of course equivalent to saying that art must have a moral justification or better that art must have a moral motive To us relationship is not enough there must be additional significance either in beauty or in symbolism the beauty of associations which in the last resort are not other than physiological or the symbolism of something other than the actual relationship presented To us also the conceit if exalted to so high a place of honour involves a certain degree of admixture in art of triviality that seems to break up the surface of a work too much fretting a great expanse of calm with detailed tomfoolery Gracian canons of taste here though relevant do not go far enough But it is also true that in exalted moods of apprehension we are able to admit all things into a just relationship of regeneration in grace where triviality ceases to exist where consciousness floats on the high seas of complete understanding seeing them one in Christ In such a mood the mind can take any element however humble gross even and see it in its relationship with the whole and perceiving that relationship use it as a term of comparison of elucidation Such moods are rare to many they are unknown and in essence to live in that exaltation is to live the mystical life Those sermons so often quoted by Gracian far from being suited to their worldly audience can be understood only in the seclusion of a cloister they may be understood by the illumined but they cannot illumine the dark minded The simplest example is the Eucharist No subject lends itself so well to conceptistic treatment yet even believers may be offended if the canon of suitability prescribed by Gracian be not observed For him however who lives in a world where the great scheme of salvation as he understands it alone is dominant nothing can be an unworthy term of comparison for this great dogma if it help the intellect to understand or inflame the heart to appreciate the order and balance that this fact implies in the composition of his universe But these conceptist sermons are fruitless to the mind not already dwelling on the plane of mental and spiritual exaltation they may not arouse understanding they can only excite derision
